provided that the failure to deliver at the Closing an instrument of transfer with respect to the NewCo Equity Interests of any NewCo Entity that are not transferred to Purchaser at the Closing in accordance with Section 2.18 shall not constitute a failure to perform, or breach or violation of, this clause (viii) to the extent that Seller has used reasonable best efforts to cause such portion of the Pre-Closing Restructuring to have been completed prior to the Closing;(ix)a counterpart signature page, duly executed by each Seller Entity, to the Subcontract Agreement;

(a)Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Purchaser a written statement (the “Estimated Closing Statement”) setting forth (i) Seller’s good faith estimate of Closing Date Net Working Capital (such estimate, the “Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital”), Closing Date Indebtedness (such estimate, the “Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness”), and the Transaction Expenses (such estimate, the “Estimated Transaction Expenses”), (ii) Seller’s good faith calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and (iii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price, together with reasonable supporting information, schedules and data as may be appropriate with respect to the calculation of all such amounts. The Estimated Closing Statement shall set forth the calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with Section 2.10(h). Seller shall reasonably consider in good faith any revisions to the Estimated Closing Statement proposed by Purchaser prior to the Closing; provided that, the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by Seller, as revised in accordance with this sentence (if applicable), shall be binding on the Parties for purposes of the Estimated Purchase Price and such requirement to consider in good faith any proposed revisions shall not delay the Closing.(b)As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Purchaser a written statement (the “Post-Closing Statement”), setting forth (i) Seller’s good faith calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, (ii) Seller’s good faith calculation of the Closing Date Net Working 31Capital Adjustment Amount and (iii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Purchase Price, together with all reasonable supporting information, schedules and data upon which such statement is based. In no event shall the Post-Closing Statement be permitted to be delivered on more than one occasion or amended subsequent to the initial submission. The Post-Closing Statement shall set forth the calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with Section 2.10(h). (c)From the Closing through the date that the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, Purchaser shall permit Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives to have reasonable access (including the right to make copies) during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice to Purchaser, to Purchaser’s and its Affiliates’ (including the NewCo Entities’) books, records and computations relating to the Post-Closing Statement, Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Purchase Price and to discuss the foregoing with Representatives of the GES Business and, in connection with Seller’s preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, Purchaser shall and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to provide reasonable assistance during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice to Purchaser, to Seller in connection therewith. In exercising its rights hereunder, Seller shall, and shall instruct its Affiliates and Representatives to, conduct itself or themselves, as applicable, so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the businesses of Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the GES Business, following the Closing.(d)Until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is the sixtieth (60th) day following receipt by Purchaser of the Post-Closing Statement (such sixty (60) day period, the “Review Period”), Purchaser shall be entitled to deliver written notice to Seller of any dispute (a “Dispute”) Purchaser has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content of the Post-Closing Statement (the “Dispute Notice”); provided, however, that the Dispute Notice shall be permitted to include only objections and calculations based on (A) non-compliance with this Agreement or the Transaction Accounting Principles and (B) mathematical errors in the calculation of the amounts on the Post-Closing Statement; provided, further, that if Purchaser does not deliver any Dispute Notice to Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Post-Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Dispute, the amount(s) involved and Purchaser’s good faith determination of the (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, (ii) Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and (iii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Purchase Price. Upon receipt by Seller of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Dispute set forth therein. If Seller and Purchaser reach an agreement in writing as to any such Dispute that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Dispute Notice within the Dispute Resolution Period (as defined below), the amounts so agreed shall be final and such agreement shall be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding for purposes of this Section 2.10(d). If Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve any Dispute within thirty (30) days (or a different number of days as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Parties) after delivery of the Dispute Notice (such thirty (30) day or other mutually agreed period, the “Dispute Resolution Period”), then either Purchaser or Seller may submit such Dispute to a nationally recognized accounting or other firm with an active practice area focused on purchase price dispute resolution in connection with mergers and acquisitions reasonably agreeable to each of Seller and Purchaser, solely for resolution of those items on the Dispute Notice that remain in Dispute (the “Items”); provided that, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the Independent Accounting Firm within ten (10) Business Days, then either Party may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint a partner in an independent accounting firm who is a certified public accountant, independent and impartial, with at least ten (10) years of dispute resolution experience related to purchase price adjustment disputes (the accounting firm that is ultimately engaged pursuant to this Section 2.10(d), the “Independent Accounting Firm”). The Parties shall 32jointly engage the Independent Accounting Firm (including through the execution and delivery of a customary engagement letter upon request), within ten (10) Business Days following the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period or submission of the Items to the Independent Accounting Firm, whichever is later. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than fifteen (15) days following the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser and Seller shall prepare and submit a written statement of proposed resolution of each Item, with supporting documentation, as applicable, to the Independent Accounting Firm and the other Party. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have ten (10) days after receipt of the other Party’s written statement to deliver to the Independent Accounting Firm and the other Party written rebuttal thereto (if applicable). In resolving the Items, the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resorting to the Independent Accounting Firm as provided in this Section 2.10(d) shall be the only recourse and remedy of the Parties with respect to, any Disputes arising out of, relating to or resulting from the calculation of, and any adjustments to, the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Purchase Price. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to fully and finally resolve the Items by written determination to be rendered as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty (20) days after the later of the submission of the opening written statement(s) or the rebuttal statement(s), as applicable; provided that any failure of the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver its written determination within such time period shall not constitute a defense or objection to the finality or enforcement of such determination. The Independent Accounting Firm shall make such written final determination regarding the appropriate amount of each of the Items based solely on the written statement(s) of Purchaser, on the one hand, and of Seller, on the other hand, supporting information submitted by Purchaser and Seller and the terms of this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). With respect to each Item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in the Post-Closing Statement or Dispute Notice, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of the Disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether each Item was properly calculated in accordance with this Agreement, including the Transaction Accounting Principles (as applicable) and the definitions set forth herein. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall authorize the Independent Accounting Firm to modify or amend any term or provision hereof or modify items previously agreed in writing between Seller and Purchaser. A copy of all materials submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm shall be provided by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, to the other Party concurrently with the submission thereof to the Independent Accounting Firm. Neither Seller nor Purchaser may disclose to the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Independent Accounting Firm may not consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer(s) made by or on behalf of either Seller or Purchaser unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall communicate with the Independent Accounting Firm unless the other Party is present or party to such communication. All determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing Statement, as modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties absent Fraud or manifest error. The Parties agree that any adjustment as determined pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by Law.(e)All fees and expenses charged by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in proportion to the allocation of the Dollar value of the amounts in dispute between Seller and Purchaser resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, such that the Party prevailing on the greatest Dollar value of such Disputes pays the lesser proportion of the fees. For example, should the items in dispute total one thousand Dollars ($1,000) and the Independent Accounting Firm awards six hundred Dollars ($600) in favor of Seller’s position, then sixty percent (60%) of the fees and expenses of its review would be borne 33by Purchaser and forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of its review would be borne by Seller.(f)For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.10, each of Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with and provide to each other and their respective Representatives reasonable access (including the right to make copies) during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice to the other Party, to all information, books, records and data, in each case to the extent related to the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price submitted by Seller, Purchase Price submitted by Seller, or the Dispute Notice submitted by Purchaser, and all personnel involved in preparing such calculation or the Dispute Notice, as applicable, and shall permit access to its respective facilities and personnel as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of, the Estimated Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement or the Dispute Notice, as applicable, and the resolution of any Disputes. In exercising their rights hereunder, each Party shall, and shall instruct its Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, conduct themselves so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the businesses of the other Party and its Affiliates following the Closing. In the event that any of Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, does not comply with the first sentence of this Section 2.10(f) in a manner which delays in any material respect the ability of (x) Seller to submit the Post-Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.10(b) or (y) Purchaser to submit (or not submit) the Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 2.10(d), in each case, in the applicable time period set forth in such Sections, then, if such non-compliance is not cured within five (5) days of delivery of written notice from the other Party setting out in reasonable detail such non-compliance and the information to which it relates, the applicable time period shall be extended by one (1) day for each additional day required for the non-complying Party, its Affiliates and Representatives, as applicable, to reasonably comply with the request that is the subject of such written notice.(g)If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.10 exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an amount in cash equal to such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, and if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.10 is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser. Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.10(g) shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.10.(h)Each of the Estimated Closing Statement (including the Estimated Purchase Price and components thereof) and the Post-Closing Statement (including the Purchase Price and components thereof) shall be prepared and calculated (i) in accordance with the definitions of such terms contained in this Agreement and the Transaction Accounting Principles (as applicable) and (ii) on the basis that the GES Business is a going concern and shall exclude any fees or expenses incurred pursuant to responding to any requests initiated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. The Parties expressly agree and acknowledge that the purpose of preparing the calculations and purchase price adjustment under this Section 2.10 is to give effect only to the arithmetic difference between items in the Estimated Closing Statement and the Post-Closing Statement, and, in undertaking the processes pursuant to this Section 2.10, the Parties shall not introduce different accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications, estimation methodologies or judgments (including with respect to management discretion and judgment) in contravention of the Transaction Accounting Principles. The Post-Closing Statement (including the Purchase Price and components thereof) shall be based solely on facts and circumstances as they exist as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (with respect to Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness) and as of immediately prior to the Closing (with respect to Transaction Expenses), and no Effect, including any market or 34business development or change in GAAP or applicable Law, arising or occurring after such time, as applicable, shall be taken into consideration in the calculations to be made pursuant to this Section 2.10.Section 2.11 Purchase Price Allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and any applicable U.S. state or U.S. local Tax purposes), treat the purchase of the NewCo Equity Interests as a purchase of the assets of each of the NewCo Entities. The Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.10) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date shall be allocated amongst the assets of the NewCo Entities and the Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. No later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.10, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.10) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date (“Seller’s Allocation”). If Purchaser disagrees with Seller’s Allocation, Purchaser may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of Seller’s Allocation, deliver a written notice (“Purchaser’s Allocation Notice”) to Seller to such effect, specifying those items as to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchaser’s proposed allocation. If Purchaser’s Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, attempt in good faith to resolve any disputed items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.10) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree to an allocation of the Purchase Price, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. The allocation, as finalized pursuant to this Section 2.11 (the “Allocation”), shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any position inconsistent with the Allocation on any relevant Tax Return or in any relevant Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law).Section 2.12 Non-Assignment; Consents. (a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, deliver or convey any assets, Contracts or rights, including any Purchased Asset, if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof would, without receiving any Regulatory Approval or other approval, authorization or consent of, filing or registration with, notification to, or granting or issuance of any Permit, order or waiver by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (collectively, “Approval” and such assets, Contracts and rights that, in each case, would otherwise be considered Purchased Assets, collectively, the “Non-Assignable Assets”), (i) be prohibited by applicable Law or Contract, (ii) constitute a breach or other contravention of any such Law or Contract, or result in an acceleration of the rights of termination of any counterparty (including in the case of any request for approval or consent, in which case no such request shall be made without the agreement of the Parties), (iii) be ineffective, void or voidable or (iv) subject Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, Purchaser, or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates to any civil or criminal liability, unless and until such Regulatory Approval or other Approval (including in the case of any rights of termination) is obtained, it being understood that, subject to Seller’s and its Affiliates’ compliance with their obligations set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.27, the receipt of any Approval (other than the Approvals described in Section 7.1(a)) is not a condition to the Closing and that the Closing shall proceed in accordance with this Agreement, and Purchaser shall pay the full Estimated Purchase Price at the 35Closing without the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or delivery of such Non-Assignable Assets.(b)From the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of one (1) year following the Closing Date and the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any Approval (other than (x) Regulatory Approvals, which is governed by Section 5.1, and (y) with respect to Shared Contracts, which is governed by Section 2.12(c)) required to sell, assign or transfer the Non-Assignable Assets and, subject to the consummation of such sale, assignment or transfer, to obtain the unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to any Assumed Liabilities related to such Non-Assignable Assets so that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for such Assumed Liabilities from and after the Closing.

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.12 to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the case of any Shared Contracts, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts (including to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any Approval of the other party or parties to such Shared Contract in connection therewith) to (i) divide, separate, modify or replicate (in whole or in part) the respective portions of such Shared Contract that are Related to the GES Business (any such resulting Contract that is Related to the GES Business, a “Replacement Contract”) or (ii) novate the respective rights and obligations under and in respect of the Shared Contracts, such that, effective as of the Closing, (A) Purchaser or its Affiliate is the beneficiary of the post-Closing rights and benefits and is responsible for the post-Closing Liabilities and obligations under such Shared Contract, in each case, to the extent that they are Related to the GES Business (so that, from and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no post-Closing rights or benefits or post-Closing Liabilities and obligations under such Shared Contract to the extent that they are Related to the GES Business) and (B) Seller or its Affiliate is the beneficiary of the rights and benefits and is responsible for the Liabilities and obligations under such Shared Contract to the extent that they are not Related to the GES Business (so that, from and after the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no post-Closing rights or benefits or post-Closing Liabilities under such Shared Contract to the extent that they are not Related to the GES Business) (any such division, separation, modification, replication or novation, a “Contract Split”); provided that the foregoing obligations in this Section 2.12(c) shall not apply to any Shared Contract used by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the NewCo Entities) in connection with the provision of corporate level services of the type provided to the GES Business prior to the Closing. 36(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Seller, any of its Affiliates nor Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to pay any consent, approval or waiver “fee,” discount, rebate or any money or other consideration beyond de-minimis costs to any Person, agree to any modification or amendment of or any concession to any counterparty to any Contract, or to initiate any Proceeding against any Person in order to obtain any Approvals (including with respect to any Shared Contract); provided that, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or Purchaser, may make any commercially reasonable accommodations regarding, or amendments to, any Contracts in order to obtain any Approvals; provided, further, that Purchaser’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required with respect to any accommodations regarding, or any amendment to any material provision (including any price or other economic terms and any provisions relating to the term or termination of such Contract) of, any Contract with an SDO.

To the extent that Seller or its Affiliates pay or discharge an Assumed Liability from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller or the applicable Affiliate for any amount so paid or discharged. To the extent that, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser, the NewCo Entities or their Affiliates pay or discharge a Liability that is not an Assumed Liability but was assigned, transferred and conveyed to Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) pursuant to this Agreement, Seller or one of its Affiliates shall promptly reimburse Purchaser, such NewCo Entity or such applicable Affiliate for any amount so paid or discharged.

Assuming that the Regulatory Approvals described in Section 3.3(b) are obtained and made, the execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (other than the Local Transfer Agreements) to which Purchaser is or, as of the Closing, will be a party do not, and the consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by such other Transaction Documents and compliance by Purchaser with the terms of this Agreement and such other Transaction Documents (other than the Local Transfer Agreements) will not, conflict with, require filing under or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries under, or any payment being required or penalty under, any provision of (a) the Organizational Documents of Purchaser, (b) any Law applicable to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, or the properties or assets of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or (c) any Contract pursuant to which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of clauses (b) or (c), for any such items that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article III, no Regulatory Approval or other Approval is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Purchaser in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and with any other Antitrust Law, (ii) compliance with any applicable FDI Laws, (iii) any Approval that is applicable as a result of matters specifically related to Seller or any of its Affiliates, (iv) any applicable FAR Approval, and (v) those that, if not obtained, made or given, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.4 Sufficiency of Funds.(a)Purchaser has delivered to Seller a complete, correct and fully executed copy of an equity commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) from KKR North America Fund XIII SCSP (the “Guarantor”) pursuant to which Guarantor has committed to provide cash equity to Purchaser in the aggregate amount, and subject to the terms and conditions, set forth therein (the “Equity Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, has not been withdrawn, rescinded, or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect (other than an amendment or modification made in compliance with Section 5.15(b)) and is a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and each of the other parties thereto, in each case, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Seller is an express third-party beneficiary of the rights granted to Purchaser under 58the Equity Commitment Letter only for the purpose of seeking specific performance of Purchaser’s right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded thereunder (solely to the extent that Purchaser is permitted to enforce the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms thereof). Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III, the performance by the Seller of its obligations contained in this Agreement and that the conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied at the Closing, (i) as of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a failure of any condition to the funding of the Equity Financing or result in any portion of the Equity Financing being unavailable at the Closing, (ii) as of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy at the Closing any term or condition to the funding of the Equity Financing at the Closing required to be satisfied by it and contained in the Equity Commitment Letter and (iii) the aggregate proceeds of the Equity Financing as of the Closing, will be sufficient to enable Purchaser to pay the amounts required to be paid by Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(i) and all fees, costs and expenses payable by Purchaser at the Closing in connection with the Transactions. There are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings related to the Equity Financing that would adversely affect the availability or enforceability of the Equity Financing. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing except as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.(b)The Guarantor has duly executed and delivered to Seller a limited guaranty (the “Limited Guaranty”). The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor.(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt by, or availability to, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any funds or financing or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Purchaser to effect the Closing. Section 4.5 Proceedings. There are no Proceedings (other than investigations) pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing addressed and delivered to Purchaser, against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other than any Proceeding that, if adversely determined, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Purchaser, there are no investigations pending or threatened in writing addressed and delivered to Purchaser, against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other than any investigation that, if adversely determined, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.Section 4.6 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial advisor’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for which Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than, following the Closing, the NewCo Entities) would have any Liability.Section 4.7 Investigation. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller has made available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management of Seller and the GES Business and been provided with access to the documents, information and records of or with respect to the NewCo Equity Interests, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the GES Business, in each case, satisfactory to Purchaser, and Purchaser confirms that it has (i) made an independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the NewCo Equity Interests, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the GES Business and (ii) such knowledge and experience in 59financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of Purchaser’s purchase of the NewCo Equity Interests and the Purchased Assets and its assumption of the Assumed Liabilities. Section 4.8 Solvency. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III, (ii) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the GES Business provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith based on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, (iii) the NewCo Entities that have been formed as of immediately before the consummation of the Transactions, taken as a whole, are not insolvent immediately before the consummation of the Transactions and (iv) the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied, immediately following the Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.8, “Solvent” means, with respect to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that:(a)the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be greater than the total amount of the liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed) of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;(b)Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be able to pay their debts and obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and(c)Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall have adequate capital to carry on their businesses and all businesses in which they are about to engage.Section 4.9 Limitation of Warranties.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and each of its and their respective Representatives, hereby acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees that, other than those representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, the other Transaction Documents or any certificates delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, none of Seller, the Seller Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates, nor any of their respective Representatives or any other Person makes, has made or has authorized any Person to make (and Purchaser expressly disclaims reliance upon) any representation or warranty whatsoever, either express or implied, in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Transactions, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, the NewCo Equity Interests, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the GES Business. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and plans, that it is familiar with such uncertainties and it takes full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and plans. Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and each of its and their respective Representatives, further hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller, the Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall be subject to any Liability for any inaccuracy, misstatement or omission with respect to any (a) forecasts, predictions, projections or estimates for the GES Business or the operation of the business of Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing or business plan information of the 60GES Business or (b) materials, documents or information relating to the GES Business, the Purchased Assets, the NewCo Equity Interests, the Assumed Liabilities, this Agreement, the Transactions, the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents or any other matters, whether written or oral, discussion or otherwise, made available by Seller, the Seller Entities or management of the GES Business or Representatives or Affiliates of Seller or the Seller Entities to Purchaser, Purchaser’s Affiliates or Purchaser’s Representatives, including in any data room, confidential information memorandum or presentation, in each case, except as expressly set forth in Article III, any other Transaction Documents or any certificates delivered pursuant hereto or thereto. Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Article IV, none of Purchaser or any of its respective Affiliates or Representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty whatsoever, whether express or implied, to Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives.ARTICLE VCOVENANTSSection 5.1 Efforts. (a)Upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth herein, the Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents and to cause the conditions to each respective Party’s obligation to close the Transactions as set forth in Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable, including all actions and all things necessary for such Party to (i) comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents (which actions shall include furnishing all information required by applicable Law in connection with Regulatory Approvals or filings with any Governmental Entity) and (ii) obtain any Regulatory Approval and any FAR Approval in connection with the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents; provided that in connection with any consents required under FDI Laws, in no event will Purchaser or its Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, or enter into any consent decree, to accept any operational restriction, or to take any other action that, in each case, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, would reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. The Parties shall jointly develop, consult and cooperate with one another regarding, the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, or responding to any request from, inquiry by, or investigation by (including directing the timing, nature and substance of all such responses) any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; provided that, in the event of any conflict or disagreement between the Parties, Purchaser shall have the right to direct the matter that is the subject of any such conflict or disagreement, acting reasonably and following consultation with Seller and after considering in good faith all comments and advice of Seller (and its counsel). (b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof and in any event no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on January 30, 2023; and (ii) any statements, filings, notices or applications (or drafts thereof where applicable) with any applicable Governmental Entity to obtain any Regulatory Approval set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules as promptly reasonably as practicable following the date hereof. The Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any Regulatory Approvals, to respond to any requests for information from a Governmental Entity, and to contest and resist any Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that 61restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Transactions, including defending on the merits any claim asserted in any court with respect to the Transactions by any Governmental Entity. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties shall provide each other copies of all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between such Party or its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Parties shall notify and keep each other advised as to any (i) substantive communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions and (ii) Proceeding pending and known to such Party or, to its knowledge, threatened, which challenges the Transactions. Neither Party shall participate in material or substantive meetings with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Regulatory Approvals, filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meetings.(c)Without limiting the generality of Section 5.1(b), unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, Purchaser shall file as promptly as reasonably practicable, all necessary statements, filings, notices or applications (or drafts thereof where applicable) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all Regulatory Approvals necessary to be obtained under any Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws in order to consummate the Transactions.(d)As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to submit for, and the Parties hereby agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, FAR Approval for each Business Contract to which a U.S. federal Governmental Entity is a party (each, a “Prime U.S. Government Contract”), which Contracts, as of the date of this Agreement, are listed in Section 5.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, and enter into a novation agreement for each such Prime U.S. Government Contract pursuant to which all of the applicable Seller Entity’s right, title, and interest in and to such Prime U.S. Government Contract shall be validly conveyed, transferred, assigned and novated to U.S. NewCo, which reasonable best efforts shall include cooperating and coordinating with the other Party in the making of any requests as may be necessary for the novation of any Prime U.S. Government Contract, providing all necessary information required or reasonably requested by any applicable Governmental Entity or by the other Party, and using reasonable best efforts to obtain any applicable required registrations (including, if applicable, System for Award Management) for U.S. NewCo necessary to obtain FAR Approval; provided that in no event shall a failure to obtain FAR Approval or any such registrations before the Closing constitute a failure of any condition to Purchaser’s or Seller’s obligations to effect the Closing. Following the submission of a filing for FAR Approval, Purchaser shall lead, in coordination with Seller, all communications with any U.S. federal Governmental Entities regarding any Prime U.S. Government Contract. Any correspondence, invoices or other written submissions, including requests for equitable adjustments, claims, contract modifications and requests for final decisions shall be jointly coordinated between Purchaser and Seller, and Seller, if approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), shall sign and submit such written submissions to the Governmental Entity. To the extent that there is an outstanding quotation, bid, offer or proposal submitted to a U.S. federal Governmental Entity that would result in a Prime U.S. Government Contract and that is accepted after the Closing, the resulting Contract shall be treated as a Prime U.S. Government Contract for purposes of this Section 5.1(d).(e)Purchaser will not take, and will cause its Subsidiaries and the Guarantor not to take, any actions and will not do, and will cause its Subsidiaries and the Guarantor not to do, anything that would be reasonably likely to materially delay the obtaining of any Regulatory Approvals or to cause any Governmental Entity to object to the Transactions or the transactions contemplated by any other Transaction Document, including acquiring or agreeing to acquire any 62assets or businesses engaged in whole or in part in a line of business similar or related to the GES Business.(f)Subject to applicable Law, each of Purchaser and Seller shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other Party, as applicable, with all information concerning itself, its business and operations, its Affiliates, directors, officers, equityholders or ultimate beneficial owners and the directors, officers, managers, or partners of any such ultimate beneficial owners, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statements, filings, notices or applications made (or to be made) (and drafts thereof where applicable) as contemplated by this Section 5.1 to (i) any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions or the transactions contemplated by any other Transaction Document or (ii) any other Person in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring or to open and establish bank accounts in accordance with Section 2.17.

Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

(k)Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees payable to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any Regulatory Approval or other Approval pursuant to this Section 5.1 or Section 2.12.(l)Section 5.1(l) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth the certain jurisdictions in which Purchaser shall determine subject to good faith consultation with Seller if a filing under any applicable FDI Law is required or advisable (provided that Seller has the opportunity to consider the basis of any filing determination and has an opportunity to seek independent opinion and confirmation of applicable filing requirement which Purchaser shall consider in good faith), and if Purchaser determines that such filing is required or advisable, then Purchaser shall make any such filing under the applicable FDI Law.

In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms expressly set forth in this Agreement (rather than incorporated by reference herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will govern. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating to the GES Business, and Purchaser hereby acknowledges that its obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure with respect to any and all other information provided to it by or on behalf of the Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, concerning the Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates (other than with respect to the GES Business) or the Retained Business pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement for the term thereof. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as provided in Section 8.2(a) in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, each of Purchaser, KKR and their respective Affiliates may disclose the existence and terms of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Transactions to its Affiliates and their respective actual and prospective limited partners, investors and financing sources in connection with their fundraising and reporting activities (so long as such Persons agree to, are bound by Contract or are otherwise subject to confidentiality obligations to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential on terms that are not materially less stringent than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement).(b)From and after the Closing, the Seller Confidential Information shall be treated as “Confidential Information” under the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to the provisions thereof, mutatis mutandis.Section 5.4 Access to Information. 67(a)Prior to the Closing, subject to applicable Law, Seller shall afford to Purchaser, its Affiliates, its and their Representatives and the Debt Financing Sources and their Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, consistent with applicable Law and in accordance with the reasonable procedures established by Seller, to the properties, books, records, Contracts and personnel of Seller and its Subsidiaries to the extent Primarily Related to the GES Business or otherwise related to Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Business Employees, in each case, solely for the limited purpose of, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or this Agreement, facilitating the consummation of the Transactions; provided that (i) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which it or any of its Affiliates would be subject in discharging their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4 (provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek alternative means to disclose as much of such information possible without violating or otherwise adversely affecting such confidentiality obligations) and (ii) such access may be limited to the extent Seller or its applicable Subsidiary reasonably determines, in light of any epidemic, pandemic (including COVID-19) or other health emergency or any Pandemic Measure, that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any Representative of Seller or such Subsidiary (clauses (i) and (ii), the “Access Exceptions”).(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Purchaser agrees that any investigation undertaken pursuant to the access granted under, and any request for access pursuant to, Section 5.4(a) shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the GES Business, and none of Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall have any obligation under Section 5.4(a) with respect to any matter that would unreasonably interfere with the operation of the GES Business. Except as otherwise expressly required under this Agreement, none of Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall communicate with any of the employees of the GES Business without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives may communicate with, whether written or oral, (i) with managerial personnel involved in and for the purpose of (x) the separation, transition and migration of the GES Business from the Retained Business and (y) preparations for the GES Business to receive Transition Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) with managerial, finance or accounting personnel in connection with the Debt Financing or (iii) that are consistent with, and do not contain additional information not contained in, prior communications made to employees for which Seller provided its written consent, in each case of clauses (i) – (iii), to the extent such communications are not unreasonably disruptive to employees of Seller or its Affiliates (clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, the “Permitted Employee Communications”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or disclose any (i) information, if doing so (A) would, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of external counsel to Seller, violate any Law, Contract to which any of Seller, the other Seller Entities or their respective Affiliates are bound or fiduciary obligation, (B) would result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges) in the reasonable and good faith opinion of external counsel to Seller or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, or (C) could result in the disclosure of any competitively sensitive information unrelated to the GES Business, provided, in the event that Seller does not disclose any documents (or portion thereof) or information in reliance on the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C), Seller shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide reasonably prompt notice to Purchaser that it is withholding such information and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate such obligations, waive privilege or disclose such competitively sensitive information, (ii) information relating to any auction, sale or divestiture process conducted by any of Seller, the other Seller Entities or their respective Affiliates for any of Seller’s or the other Seller Entities’ or any of their respective 68Affiliates’ (or Representatives’) evaluation of the GES Business in connection therewith, including projections, financial or other information relating thereto, including the actions of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of any of Seller, the other Seller Entities or their respective Affiliates (or any committee thereof) with respect to the foregoing and (iii) Tax Return that includes any of Seller, the other Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or any Tax-related work papers.Section 5.5 Post-Closing Access.(a)Purchaser agrees to preserve and keep all (x) Transferred Books and Records and (y) such similar books, records and materials that were indirectly transferred to Purchaser by virtue of the transfer and delivery of the NewCo Equity Interests, in each case, that, except as otherwise provided in the Transaction Documents, are related to the period prior to the Closing (clauses (x) and (y), the “Purchaser Retained Records”), and not to destroy or dispose of any such Purchaser Retained Records until the date that is the later of (i) the date on which Purchaser’s or its Affiliates’, as applicable, generally applicable record retention policies and procedures permit Purchaser or its Affiliates, as applicable, to destroy or dispose such Purchaser Retained Records and (ii) such later date as may be required by Law, subject to Section 5.5(b).(b)Purchaser shall provide Seller with written notice sixty (60) days prior to destroying or disposing of the last copy of any Purchaser Retained Records (except in accordance with its record retention policies consistent with past practice) that may be reasonably required to be retained by Seller in connection with the matters set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 5.5(c), as applicable, and Seller shall have the right, at its expense, to reproduce or take any such materials no later than twenty (20) days after having received notice that such materials are to be destroyed or disposed of.(c)For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing or for such shorter period as the applicable Purchaser Retained Records are required to be retained by Purchaser in accordance with Section 5.5(a), Purchaser and any applicable Affiliates shall permit Seller, the other Seller Entities and their respective Affiliates and Representatives to have commercially reasonable access (including the right to make copies) during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice to Purchaser or such Affiliates, to the Purchaser Retained Records to the extent that such access may be reasonably required in connection with (i) preparation of any accounting records or with any audits or similar proceedings, (ii) any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand) relating to the operation of the GES Business prior to the Closing (except as otherwise provided in the Transaction Documents) or (iii) any regulatory matter. For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall use, and shall cause their Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Party and their respective Affiliates and authorized Representatives to have commercially reasonable access to such Party’s Books and Records, employees and auditors, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, if reasonably required in connection with (A) preparation of any accounting records or with any audits or similar proceedings, (B) any Proceeding relating to the operation of the GES Business prior to the Closing (except as otherwise provided in the Transaction Documents) or (C) any regulatory matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such access provided by a Party pursuant to this Section 5.5(c) may be limited on the basis of the Access Exceptions, applied mutatis mutandis.Section 5.6 Publicity. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the right to issue an initial press release with respect to the Transactions upon the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No Party nor any Affiliate or Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the Transactions or the transactions 69contemplated by the other Transaction Documents, in each case, that is inconsistent with, or contains additional information not contained in, the initial press release, without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange, in which case the Party or an Affiliate making such release or announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement (and will consider any such comments in good faith) in advance of such issuance; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the disclosure of information about the Transactions that is consistent with prior public disclosures on Purchaser’s Affiliates’ websites in the ordinary course of business.Section 5.7 Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy. Seller acknowledges that Purchaser may seek to obtain an insurance policy that provides coverage for the benefit of Purchaser or its designee as the named insured for any potential breaches of any of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article III (the “Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy”) and, upon Purchaser’s request, agrees to reasonably cooperate with and assist Purchaser in obtaining the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy, including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by providing additional diligence information as may be reasonably requested in connection with the underwriting of the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy or as may be reasonably required to address and remove any conditional exclusions under the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy. Purchaser agrees that the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy, if obtained, shall provide that the insurer shall waive and not pursue any subrogation, claims in contribution or other rights of recovery against Seller or any of its Affiliates, other than to the extent of any Fraud by Seller or such Affiliate. Purchaser shall provide such proposed Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy to Seller a reasonable amount of time in advance of the execution thereof in order to allow Seller to confirm compliance with this Section 5.7. Purchaser shall provide Seller the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the proposed Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy and shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Seller.

Seller and its Affiliates shall be express third-party beneficiaries of such amendment and waiver provisions set forth in the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy solely for purposes of enforcing its rights pursuant to this Section 5.7.

Immediately following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, continue the employment of each Business Employee employed by a NewCo Entity on the terms set forth in this Section 5.8; 70provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.8 shall constitute a guarantee of employment for any specific period of time following the Closing. (ii)ARD Employees. With respect to each Business Employee who is employed by Seller or one of its Affiliates in a jurisdiction in which the ARD is applicable and who is not employed by a NewCo Entity immediately prior to the Closing (an “ARD Employee”), Seller and Purchaser accept and agree that the Transactions constitute a relevant transfer for purposes of the ARD and to apply the ARD in all of its provisions, and accept and agree that the terms and conditions of employment of each such ARD Employee who is employed on the Closing Date and does not object to his or her transfer (to the extent such ARD Employee has the right to object) will transfer effective as of the Closing as if such terms and conditions were originally made or agreed between Purchaser or its relevant Affiliate and the applicable ARD Employee. Seller and Purchaser shall, or shall cause their relevant Affiliates to, inform and consult with any labor union, works council, or other collective employee representative group or body to the extent required by the ARD or other applicable Law or Collective Bargaining Agreement and, subject to applicable Data Protection Legislation. Seller and Purchaser shall provide such information and assistance in a timely manner as either party may reasonably require to enable it or any relevant Subsidiary to comply with its obligations under ARD. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any ARD Employee does not transfer automatically to the relevant Affiliate of Purchaser pursuant to the ARD, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate to timely identify any such ARD Employee and Purchaser shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliate to) make a written offer of employment to such ARD Employee, on the terms and conditions consistent with this Section 5.8, applicable Law and the terms and conditions which would have applied had such ARD Employee’s employment transferred pursuant to the ARD. Effective as of the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall cease to employ any such ARD Employee who accepts such offer.(iii)Offers of Employment. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (or such earlier time as is required by applicable Law), Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make a written offer of employment, on the terms and conditions consistent with this Section 5.8 and applicable Law, to each Business Employee (other than any ARD Employee or Employee on Leave) who is expected to be employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a NewCo Entity) immediately prior to the Closing, with each such offer effective as of, contingent upon the Closing, and providing for employment commencing as of the Closing. With respect to each Business Employee who is, as of the Closing Date, an Employee on Leave and not employed by a NewCo Entity or an ARD Employee, Purchaser shall offer employment per the terms required in this Section 5.8, to be effective upon such Employee on Leave’s return to active employment within the later of (A) the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date and (B) for any Employee on Leave outside the United States who is subject to Law which provides protections with regard to return to work, such longer period as may be required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide the template for each applicable offer letter to Seller at least five (5) Business Days in advance of delivering offers of employment to any Business Employees and each such template shall be subject to Seller’s review and approval. Effective as of the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall cease to employ any Business Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if so requested by Seller, Purchaser shall enter into a tripartite agreement with a Business Employee in lieu of Purchaser making an offer pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(iii), with terms and conditions consistent with this Section 5.8.(iv)Each Business Employee (A) who is employed by a NewCo Entity as of the Closing, (B) whose employment transfers to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ii) or (C) whose employment transfers to Purchaser or any of 71its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(iii), shall be referred to herein as a “Transferred Business Employee”.(c)Terms and Conditions of Employment. In addition to any requirements to maintain terms and conditions of employment imposed by applicable Law, with respect to each Transferred Business Employee, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) to, provide, for a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, or such longer period as required by applicable Law (the “Continuation Period”): (i) at least the same wage rate or base salary level in effect for such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities for such Transferred Business Employee that are, in each case, no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the Closing; and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing (or those that would have been in effect had the harmonization process set forth on Section 5.2(b)(i)(5) of Seller’s Disclosure Schedules been completed prior to the Closing Date), in each case, or such greater amounts as are required by applicable Law. In addition, (A) with respect to Transferred Business Employees located outside of the U.S., the Parties agree to effectuate the transfer of such Business Employees to avoid the triggering of severance payments to the extent permissible under applicable Law and (B) the terms and conditions of employment of any Business Employee subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be in accordance with the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as in effect from time to time. If Purchaser fails to provide offers which avoid the triggering of severance payments where permissible under applicable Law, Purchaser will be solely responsible for (or, if applicable, reimburse Seller in full for) the cost of any severance, redundancy, long-service, notice or garden leave pay, or similar payments, contributions or benefits that may become payable to any Business Employee as a result thereof. (d)Service Credit. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide to each Transferred Business Employee full credit for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including the determination of the level of vacation and severance pay benefits) under each employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement sponsored by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for such Transferred Business Employee’s service prior to the Closing with Seller or any of its Affiliates (or any of their predecessors), to the same extent such service was recognized by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing and, where applicable, in accordance with the ARD; provided that such service shall not be credited to the extent such credit would result in any duplication of compensation or benefits. (e)Health Coverages. Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Business Employee and his or her eligible dependents to be covered from and after the Closing by the group health plan or plans maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that (i) comply with the provisions of Section 5.8(c) or Section 5.8(j), as applicable, and (ii) do not limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any preexisting condition of such Transferred Business Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already in effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion or waiting period not in effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Transferred Business Employee full credit under Purchaser’s or such Affiliate’s group health plans, for the year in which the Closing occurs, for any deductible or co-payment already incurred by the Transferred Business Employee under the applicable group health Benefit Plan and for any other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-of-pocket expense provision of the applicable group health Benefit Plan or Purchaser’s or such Affiliate’s group health plans.(f)Severance. If (i) Purchaser fails to (A) make any Business Employee an offer of employment or enter into a tripartite agreement that, in either case, complies with the 72terms of Section 5.8 or (B) accept the employment of a Business Employee or continue the employment of a Business Employee; or (ii) any ARD Employee objects to the transfer of his or her employment to Purchaser or relevant Affiliate and, in each case, Seller or its Affiliate terminates the employment of such Business Employee within ninety (90) days following the Closing or any ARD Employee’s employment automatically terminates, then Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse and otherwise indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for any Liabilities incurred in connection with such individual’s employment from the Closing until such termination and on or in connection with the termination of such individual’s employment including notice pay and severance benefits that Seller or any of its Affiliates pays or provides to any such Business Employee under applicable Law, Collective Bargaining Agreement, any individual employment agreement and under Seller’s applicable severance plans and policies. Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse Seller and any relevant Affiliate of Seller for any amounts payable under this Section 5.8(f) as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt from Seller of appropriate verification, for all payments, costs and expenses actually paid by Seller or its Affiliates. Seller will be responsible (or, if applicable, reimburse Purchaser in full) for the cost of any severance obligation with respect to any Business Employee who objects to the transfer of his or her employment to Purchaser or relevant Affiliate where Purchaser or the relevant Affiliate has complied with the ARD or rejects Purchaser’s offer of employment on terms and conditions consistent with this Section 5.8. In the event a Transferred Business Employee’s employment is terminated during the Continuation Period by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, provide such Transferred Business Employee with severance payments and benefits equal to the greater of the (x) severance payments and benefits as set forth in Section 5.8(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and (y) severance payments and benefits required by applicable Law (if any).(g)401(k) Plan. (i)Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, have in effect a defined contribution retirement plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the “Purchaser 401(k) Plan”). Each Transferred Business Employee who is a participant immediately prior to the Closing in a defined contribution retirement plan of Seller that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a “Seller 401(k) Plan”) shall be enrolled in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable following the Closing Date. Each Transferred Business Employee who is not a participant in the Seller 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing shall be permitted to enroll in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.(ii)Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to provide each Transferred Business Employee with full credit for such Transferred Business Employee’s service with Seller or any of Seller’s Affiliates or predecessors prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.(iii)On or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall take all commercially reasonable measures needed to cause the transfer to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of all of the assets and liabilities of the Seller 401(k) Plan that are attributable to the Transferred Business Employees, including all promissory notes and receivables in respect of plan loans to the Transferred Business Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan that remain outstanding as of the Closing and accrued liabilities arising out of any applicable qualified domestic relations order. Purchaser shall direct the trustee of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept such transfer of assets and liabilities from the Seller 73401(k) Plan. Such transfer of assets and liabilities shall be made in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 411(d)(6) and 414(l) of the Code.(iv)Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to take any and all commercially reasonable measures needed to effect the transition to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of all outstanding loans under the Seller 401(k) Plan with respect to the Transferred Business Employees so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans. Such actions may include, for example, amending the Seller 401(k) Plan to permit a Transferred Business Employee to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Seller 401(k) Plan after the Closing, but before the Seller 401(k) Plan assets and liabilities are transferred to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, and adopting administrative procedures to facilitate such loan payments.(h)Flexible Spending Accounts. Seller and Purchaser, or their respective Affiliates, shall take all actions necessary or appropriate, consistent with “Situation 2” of Revenue Ruling 2002-32, including adopting the amendments described in such Revenue Ruling to the health and dependent care flexible spending account plans of Seller (the “Seller FSAs”) and Purchaser (the “Purchaser FSAs”), so that, effective as of the Closing, (i) the account balances (whether positive or negative) of the Transferred Business Employees who are participants in the Seller FSAs (the “FSA Participants”) shall be transferred to the Purchaser FSAs; (ii) the elections, contribution levels and coverage levels of the FSA Participants shall apply under Purchaser FSAs in the same manner as under the Seller FSAs; provided that Seller has provided to Purchaser all data necessary to reflect such application; and (iii) the FSA Participants shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser FSAs for claims (A) incurred at any time during the plan year of the Seller FSAs during which the Closing occurs (or during any grace period or extended grace period applicable to the Seller FSAs) and (B) submitted to the Purchaser FSAs from and after the Closing Date, substantially on the same basis, terms and conditions as under the Seller FSAs. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, if the aggregate (x) benefits paid by the Seller FSA to the Transferred Business Employees prior to the Closing exceed the aggregate payroll deductions for the Seller FSAs made in respect of the Transferred Business Employees at or prior to the Closing, then Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the amount of such excess or (y) payroll deductions for the Seller FSAs made in respect of the Transferred Business Employees at or prior to the Closing exceed the aggregate benefits paid by the Seller FSAs to the Transferred Business Employees prior to the Closing, then Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for the amount of such excess. The Parties hereby agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to implement the provisions of this Section 5.8(h), taking into account the complexity of transferring flexible spending accounts.(i)Cash Incentive Compensation. (i)Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause to be paid, to each Transferred Business Employee who is eligible to participate in any Benefit Plan providing annual cash incentive compensation payments in respect of calendar year 2022 (any such Benefit Plan, a “2022 Annual Cash Bonus Plan”, and any such payment, a “2022 Annual Cash Bonus”), subject to each such Transferred Business Employee’s continued employment with Seller or its Affiliates through the date the 2022 Annual Cash Bonuses are paid, based on the level of performance determined by Seller in its sole discretion.(ii)Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause to be paid to each Transferred Business Employee [***] any bonus due to him or her under any Benefit Plan providing annual cash incentive compensation payments in respect of calendar year 2023 (any such Benefit Plan, a “2023 Annual Cash Bonus Plan”), subject to each such 74Transferred Business Employee’s continued employment with Seller or its Affiliates through the Closing, based on the level of performance determined by Seller in its sole discretion, and prorated for the portion of the performance period elapsed under the applicable 2023 Annual Cash Bonus Plan from the beginning of such performance period through the Closing.(j)Collective Bargaining Agreements. Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, cooperate to take all steps, on a timely basis, as are required under the ARD or other applicable Law or any Collective Bargaining Agreement to notify, inform, consult with, or negotiate the effect, impact, terms or timing of the Transactions with each union, labor board, works council or employee representative group or body, or Governmental Entity where so required under applicable Law. Purchaser agrees that as of and following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, (i) recognize the unions that are signatories to the Collective Bargaining Agreements immediately prior to the Closing Date as the representatives of the Transferred Business Employees of the bargaining units described therein and (ii) assume each Collective Bargaining Agreement and to comply with the obligations thereunder.(k)Immigration Permissions. Purchaser and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall take all actions reasonably necessary to procure, transfer or maintain the visa, foreign worker status or other permissions that Business Employees require in connection with their employment by Purchaser. (l)No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of Section 10.4 and subject to Section 10.4, the provisions of this Section 5.8 are solely for the benefit of the Parties and no current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.(m)Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to effectuate the provisions set forth in this Section 5.8 relating to the transfer of the Business Employees who become Transferred Business Employees and the transfer of applicable employment-related assets and Liabilities, including by using reasonable efforts to cooperate to (i) exchange information related to Business Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries, including employment records and benefits information including Books and Records (subject to Seller’s reasonable, good faith determination that the exchange of such information is in compliance with all applicable Laws regarding the collection, use, storage, disclosure or other processing of Personal Information and the provisions of Section 2.4(f) and except to the extent disclosure thereof would constitute a breach or other contravention of any Contract or result in any waiver of any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or protection) and (ii) transfer the participation of Transferred Business Employees from Seller Plans to any benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which such Transferred Business Employees are eligible to participate on or following the Closing Date where applicable, providing benefits in accordance with Section 5.8(c). Each Transferred Business Employee shall cease all active participation in, and accrual of benefits under, any Seller Plan effective as of the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) shall mutually agree, in good faith, to reasonable processes, procedures and/or documentation relating to any material employee notices, agreements and communications following the date of this Agreement in relation to the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents, including matters addressed in this Section 5.8. Section 5.9 Intellectual Property Matters. 75(a)Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.9(a), neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall use, or have the right to use, the Seller Marks following the Closing Date.

From and after the Closing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall challenge or assist any third party to challenge the validity, enforceability or ownership of any of the Seller Marks.(b)At Purchaser’s request, for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain a statement and a link on Seller’s and its Affiliates’ primary website for the GES Business (spglobal.com/engineering), in form and substance reasonably agreeable to each of Seller and Purchaser, directing customers to the primary post-Closing website for the GES Business.(c)(i)Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to the NewCo Entities, effective as of the Closing, a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, sub-licensable (as set forth in this Section 5.9(c)) and transferable (as set forth in this Section 5.9(c)) license to use, reproduce, store, distribute, copy, modify, display, transmit and create derivative works of the SAM Software, for use in the GES Business following the Closing.

Payments by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax saving or benefit realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of, or arising from the recognition of, such Loss (determined on a with and without basis and, in each case, solely to the extent such saving or benefit is realized in the year the Loss is incurred or the indemnity payment is made or the immediately following year). In the event that an insurance, indemnification, contribution or other recovery is made or such Tax saving or benefit is realized by the Indemnified Parties with respect to any Loss for which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Article IX, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery or benefit (less (i) any reasonable costs associated with such recovery or benefit and (ii) any Taxes attributable to 94such recovery or benefit) shall be paid promptly in immediately available funds to the Indemnifying Party that provided such indemnification to the Indemnified Parties.(b)Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the same Loss.(c)Without limiting any of Purchaser’s rights with respect to Seller Taxes, no indemnity may be sought hereunder in respect of any Losses to the extent such Loss (i) has been (or will be) taken into account in determining the Purchase Price or (ii) is or may be recovered under the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy (disregarding any retention or limitation of liability set forth therein).Section 9.5 Indemnification Procedures. The provisions of this Section 9.5 shall apply to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article IX. (a)Claim Procedure. In order for any Indemnified Party to be entitled to make a claim for indemnification under this Article IX, Purchaser (on behalf of such Indemnified Party to the extent it is a Purchaser Indemnified Party) or Seller (on behalf of such Indemnified Party to the extent it is a Seller Indemnified Party) shall deliver a written notice (an “Indemnification Claim Notice”) to the applicable Indemnifying Party, promptly after it acquires knowledge of any fact, event or circumstance that may give rise to a claim for Losses pursuant to this Article IX. Each Indemnification Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of, the facts, circumstances and the amount or a good faith estimate (only to the extent ascertainable) of the potential Losses against which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification for, such claim asserted, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made; provided, however, that any failure by Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of such Indemnified Party) to give such prompt Indemnification Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced thereby. After delivery of an Indemnification Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, (i) the Indemnified Party on behalf of which Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, has provided such Indemnification Claim Notice shall, upon written request from the Indemnifying Party, make available to the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives all relevant information and all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in its or its Affiliates’ possession or under its control relating to the claim reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party (except to the extent that such action would result in a loss of attorney-client privilege; provided, that such Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information in such format to the Indemnifying Party, or on an outside counsel only basis or in such other manner which would not result in the loss of such attorney-client privilege) and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives, to, (A) be reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives during normal business hours to discuss such claim and (B) provide reasonable access to such properties, facilities, books, records, accountant work papers and other documents or information in their possession or under their control upon the Indemnifying Party and/or its Representatives may reasonably request (at the Indemnifying Party’s cost and expense) (provided, that the accountants of the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Indemnifying Party or its Representatives unless and until such party or such Representative, as applicable, has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants). 95(b)Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a “Direct Claim”) shall be asserted by Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of such Indemnified Party) by delivering an Indemnification Claim Notice with respect to such Direct Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after it acquires knowledge of any fact, event or circumstance that may give rise to a claim for Losses pursuant to this Article IX; provided, however, that any failure by Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of such Indemnified Party) to give such prompt Indemnification Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of their indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party are actually materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party as provided in Section 9.5(a). The Indemnifying Party may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice with respect to such Direct Claim, deliver to Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of the Indemnified Party) a written response disputing such claim, which response must state in reasonable detail the basis for and reasons why the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, together with reasonable supporting detail. If the Indemnifying Party fails to deliver a written response disputing such claim in accordance with the foregoing sentence within such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have waived its right to dispute such claim and such claim shall have been deemed to have been agreed to by the Indemnifying Party.(c)Third-Party Claims.(i)If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any action made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a “Third-Party Claim”) against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of such Indemnified Party) shall deliver an Indemnification Claim Notice with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after it acquires knowledge of any fact, event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for Losses pursuant to this Article IX; provided, however, the failure to give such prompt Indemnification Claim Notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party are actually materially prejudiced thereby. Such Indemnification Claim Notice by Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of the Indemnified Party) shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, and where reasonably practicable, shall include copies that are in such Party’s possession or under its control of all letters, claims, complaints, filings, documents and correspondence received by the Indemnified Party or its Representatives with respect thereto. (ii)The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, by giving written notice to Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of the Indemnified Party) within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice relating to such Third-Party Claim acknowledging that such Third-Party Claim is subject to the indemnification obligations pursuant to this Article IX, to assume and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement at the Indemnifying Party’s expense and by the Indemnifying Party’s own counsel; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third-Party Claim (A) seeks relief other than the payment of monetary damages or could result in the imposition of a Judgment that would restrict in any respect any present or future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) seeks a finding or admission of a violation of Law (including any Third-Party Claim seeking to impose criminal fines, 96penalties or sanctions) or of a violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (C) is made by an SDO, then, in each such case, Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of such Indemnified Party) shall be entitled to solely direct the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel of its choosing (and at its own cost and expense).(iii)In the event that the Indemnifying Party is permitted pursuant to Section 9.5(c) and timely notifies the Indemnified Party that it desires to assume and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.5(c)(ii), it shall diligently prosecute such Third-Party Claim and it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of with a single counsel and a single local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction selected by such Indemnified Party subject to the Indemnifying Party’s right to control the defense thereof; provided, that if there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party as has been determined by the Indemnified Party’s outside legal counsel or if there are one or more different defenses to such Third-Party Claim available to the Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnifying Party, on the other hand, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of one (1) counsel and one (1) local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, in each case, of the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an indemnifiable Loss hereunder.(iv)If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim or is not permitted to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim, fails to timely notify Purchaser or Seller by the deadline pursuant to Section 9.5(c)(ii) (as applicable, on behalf of the Indemnified Party) in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently defend the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to the provisions of this Article IX, assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnifying Party, on the other hand, shall keep the other and the other’s Representatives reasonably informed concerning the status of any such Third-Party Claim and any related proceedings and all stages thereof. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement) and retaining records relevant or relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense for, and the defense of, such Third-Party Claim.(v)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.5(c)(ii), the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of the Indemnified Party), compromise or otherwise enter into any judgment or settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser or Seller (as applicable, on behalf of the Indemnified Party), other than a compromise, judgment or settlement that (A) is on exclusively monetary terms with, subject to the limitations in Section 9.4, such monetary amounts paid by the Indemnifying Party concurrently with the effectiveness of the compromise, 97judgement or settlement, (B) does not involve any finding or admission of violation of Law or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party and (C) provides in customary form, an unconditional and complete release of, or dismissal with prejudice of, all claims against any Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party exercises its right to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.5(c)(ii), the Indemnified Party shall so control the defense of the Third-Party Claim diligently and shall, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, keep the Indemnifying Party promptly apprised of all developments with respect to such Third-Party Claim. In addition, if the Indemnified Party exercises its right to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.5(c)(ii), the Indemnified Party shall not enter into any settlement of, or consent to the entry of any Judgment with respect to, a Third-Party Claim pursuant to which the Indemnifying Party would have any Liability, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If an Indemnified Party settles a Third-Party Claim or consents to the entry of any Judgment with respect to a Third-Party Claim, in each case, it is defending or is entitled to defend pursuant to this Section 9.5(c) without obtaining the Indemnifying Party’s written consent to such settlement or consent in violation of the immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result thereof, then the Indemnifying Party shall be fully relieved of its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim.(vi)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent a Third-Party Claim relates to Taxes, such Third-Party Claim shall be governed by Article VI and not this Article IX.(d)Final Resolution. An Indemnification Claim Notice, any amounts claimed therein and any other matters set forth therein shall be deemed to be finally resolved for purposes of this Article IX when such Indemnification Claim Notice, amounts and matters have been resolved by (i) a written agreement executed by Seller and Purchaser or (ii) a final, non-appealable order, decision or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator with respect to such matter in dispute or portion thereof (clauses (i) and (ii), together, a “Final Resolution”).(e)Manner of Payment. Any indemnification with respect to any claim pursuant to this Article IX shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party within five (5) Business Days after the Final Resolution thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated in writing by the applicable Indemnified Party.Section 9.6 Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses promptly after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder, in each case, to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX. Section 9.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including Section 2.10 and Section 5.11, pursuant to the Purchaser R&W Insurance Policy and in respect of Fraud in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provided in this Article IX, subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing monetary remedy available to any party or Indemnified Party in connection with any Losses arising out of or resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article IX shall limit or restrict the ability or right of any Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief (other than monetary relief), in accordance with Section 10.6, for any breach or alleged breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms are to be performed after the Closing; provided, however, that any procedures in respect of and 98limitations on Losses or liabilities in this Article IX shall in no event be diminished or circumvented by such relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it and each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties may not avoid any limitation on liability by (a) seeking damages for breach of Contract or tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which are hereby waived, or (b) asserting or threatening any claim against any Person that is not a Party (or a successor to a Party) for breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. The Parties agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on Purchaser Indemnified Parties’ and Seller Indemnified Parties’ remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Section 9.4), were specifically bargained for among sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to Seller hereunder.ARTICLE XGENERAL PROVISIONSSection 10.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Subcontract Agreement, and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Subcontract Agreement and the Seller Disclosure Schedules, all arise out of, and relate to, the same underlying transactions, constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties relating to such subject matter. Section 10.2 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights, interests and obligations hereunder may not be assigned or transferred by either Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided that Purchaser may assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part and at any time, without obtaining the other Party’s prior written consent, (a) to one or more of its Affiliates, (b) to any Person, solely after the Closing, in connection with an internal restructuring, joint venture, sale or divestiture of all or a portion of the direct or indirect equity interests or assets of Purchaser, the NewCo Entities or any of their respective Affiliates; provided, further, that such assignment pursuant to the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, further, that Purchaser may assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part and at any time, without obtaining any Person’s prior written consent to any lender or debt financing source of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as collateral. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 10.2 shall be void. Subject to the two preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.Section 10.3 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except by an instrument in writing signed and delivered on behalf of each of the Parties. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of either Party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition of this Agreement may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply.Section 10.4 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, are not intended to confer on behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and permitted assigns) any legal or equitable rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies with respect to the subject matter or any provision hereof, except that (i) the Current Representation is an express third-party beneficiary of Section 10.13, (ii) each Covered Person is an express third-party beneficiary of Section 5.12, (iii) each Seller Related Party (other than Seller) and each Purchaser 99Related Party (other than Purchaser) is an express third-party beneficiary of Section 8.2, (iii) each Seller Indemnified Party (other than Seller) and each Purchaser Indemnified Party (other than Purchaser) is an express third-party beneficiary of Article IX, and (iv) each Non-Party is an express third-party beneficiary of Section 10.7.

Arcano 100Jeffrey A. BrillEmail: Stephen.Arcano@skadden.comJeffrey.Brill@skadden.comSection 10.6 Specific Performance. The Parties hereby agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to Section 8.2 and Section 9.1, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise by a Party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other such remedy. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Either Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction. In no event shall the exercise of a Party’s right to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section 10.6 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit such Party’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or to pursue any other applicable remedy at law, including seeking money damages, to the extent permitted by this Agreement; provided that under no circumstances shall such Party be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance contemplated by this Section 10.6 and payment of any money damages arising out of the termination of this Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2 (but such Party shall be entitled to seek both remedies simultaneously).Section 10.7 Release. (a)Effective as of the Closing, each of the Parties, for itself and its respective Affiliates and their respective past, present or future successors, assigns, executors, heirs, officers, directors, managers, partners and employees (each, as to the applicable releasing Party, its “Releasor”), hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily releases, discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all claims, demands, obligations, liabilities, debts, guarantees, assurances, commitments, defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, Proceedings and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, asserted or unasserted, contingent or fixed, in law, equity or otherwise, which any of such Party’s Releasors has, might have or might assert now or in the future, against the other Party and any of such other Party’s Affiliates and their respective past, present or future successors, assigns, officers, directors, managers, partners, agents, representatives and employees or any of their respective heirs, assigns or executors (in each case in their capacity as such) (each, as to the applicable released Party, a “Releasee”), to the extent arising out of, related to or resulting from the ownership or operation of any NewCo Entity or the GES Business, in each case, which occurred, existed, accrued, or was taken or permitted at or prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 10.7 shall release, waive, discharge, relinquish or otherwise affect the obligations of any of the Parties (or any of such Party’s Releasee to the extent an express party of the following agreements) (i) under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including any covenants that expressly survive the Closing or any claim for Fraud) or (ii) to the extent a Releasee was or is an officer, director, employee, contractor or other service provider of any NewCo Entity or the GES Business or any of their respective Subsidiaries, any (A) rights or claims under currently-existing employee benefit plans, health insurance plans and 101retirement plans (but not including any benefit plans or plan provisions relating to grants of equity or equity-based awards), (B) rights or claims for unpaid salary, benefits and reimbursements of expenses for services actually provided by the undersigned and payable in the ordinary course of business, and that, in each case, has been earned and accrued in the ordinary course of business, (C) rights to indemnification, exculpation, advancement of expenses or similar provision, (D) Retained Claims or (E) arising out of any employment agreement or grant agreement with such Releasee, or any claims with respect to fraud, willful misconduct or criminality of such Releasee arising in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, contractor or other service provider of any NewCo Entity or the GES Business or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Releasors to, refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced any Proceeding, of any kind against the other Party and such other Party’s Releasees based upon any matter released pursuant to this Section 10.7. Each Party hereby acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of its Releasors, that the legal requirements of certain states provide substantially the following: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.” Each Party hereby acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of its Releasors, that such legal requirements are designed to protect a Person from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, each Party knowingly and irrevocably hereby acknowledges and agrees, for itself and on behalf of its Releasors, that, from and after the Closing, such Party and such Party’s Releasors shall be deemed to waive their rights under any such legal requirements.(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement (including the U.K. BTA) shall be had against any Person who is not a Party (including any past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, direct or indirect equityholder, management company, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or financing source to any such Persons or any successor or assign, past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, direct or indirect equityholder, management company, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or financing source to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Non-Parties”)) whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or obligation whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Party for any obligation of a Party under this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance, or any breach (whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement (including the U.K. BTA) for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation; provided, that the foregoing shall not limit, modify or otherwise impair any Person’s rights, remedies or obligations under any Transaction Document to which it is a party (only to the extent of the specific rights, remedies or obligations of such parties set forth in such Transaction Document). All claims, obligations, liabilities, causes of action or proceedings (in each case whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil and whether at law or in equity, and whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance, or any breach (whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith shall be made only against the Parties and to the maximum 102extent permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives and releases all such claims, obligations, liabilities, causes of action or proceedings against any such Non-Parties; provided, that the foregoing shall not limit, modify or otherwise impair any Person’s rights, remedies or obligations under any Transaction Document to which it is a party (only to the extent of the specific rights, remedies or obligations of such parties set forth in such Transaction Document). Without limiting the foregoing, no claim will be brought or maintained by any Party or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective successors or permitted assigns against, and no Person shall seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Party, and no recourse will be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach or nonperformance of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any Party hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder; provided, that the foregoing shall not limit, modify or otherwise impair any Person’s rights, remedies or obligations under any Transaction Document to which it is a party (only to the extent of the specific rights, remedies or obligations of such parties set forth in such Transaction Document).Section 10.8 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. (a)This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

The Parties agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between any Designated Person, on the one hand, and any of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities), on the other hand, solely arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transactions, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby (a “Post-Closing Matter”), a Current Representation may represent such Designated Person in such Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of such Designated Person may be directly adverse to Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities), except in any case in which (x) such Current Representation has represented the NewCo Entities or their respective Affiliates in a matter substantially related to such dispute or (y) at the time of the commencement of such representation, such Current Representation is representing any of Purchaser, the NewCo Entities or their respective Affiliates.(b)Purchaser hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) that, in connection with a Post-Closing Matter, all communications among any Designated Person, on the one hand, and their internal or external counsel, including any Current Representation, on the other hand, that relate in any way to this Agreement, the Transactions, any other Transaction Document or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby shall be deemed attorney-client privileged communications (collectively, the “Privileged Communications”) and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client 105confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities). The Privileged Communications are (and upon the Closing shall remain) the property of Seller, and from and after the Closing, none of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) will seek to access, use or obtain such communications or the files from the Current Representation, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through other means. As to any such Privileged Communications made prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser, together with its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities), successors and assigns, further agrees that no such party may access, use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any Proceeding against or involving any of the parties after the Closing. The Privileged Communications may be used by Seller in connection with any Post-Closing Matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities), on the one hand, and any other Person or Persons (other than a party to this Agreement or any of its respective Affiliates), on the other hand, after the Closing, Purchaser or its Affiliate (including the NewCo Entities) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such Person or Persons; provided, however, that none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the NewCo Entities) may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.Section 10.14 Disclosure.

In addition, each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors must include the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 9 of this Article II. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.3.(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3, if expressly requested in the relevant Nomination Notice (as defined below), the Company shall include in its proxy statement for any annual meeting of stockholders (but not at any special meeting of stockholders): (i) the name of any person nominated for election (the “Stockholder Nominee”), which shall also be included on the Company’s form of proxy and ballot, by any Eligible Stockholder (as defined below) or group of up to 20 Eligible Stockholders that, as determined by the Board of Directors or its designee, has (individually and collectively, in the case of a group) satisfied all applicable conditions and complied with all applicable procedures set forth in this Section 3 (such Eligible Stockholder or group of Eligible Stockholders being a “Nominating8Stockholder”); (ii) disclosure about the Stockholder Nominee and the Nominating Stockholder required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law to be included in the proxy statement; (iii) any statement included by the Nominating Stockholder in the Nomination Notice for inclusion in the proxy statement in support of the Stockholder Nominee’s election to the Board of Directors (subject, without limitation, to Section 3(e)(ii)), provided that such statement does not exceed 500 words; and (iv) any other information that the Company or the Board of Directors determines, in their discretion, to include in the proxy statement relating to the nomination of the Stockholder Nominee, including, without limitation, any statement in opposition to the nomination and any of the information provided pursuant to this Section 3. The Company may solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statement relating to, any Stockholder Nominee.(b)(i) The Company shall not be required to include in the proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders more Stockholder Nominees than that number of directors constituting 20% of the total number of directors of the Company on the last day on which a Nomination Notice may be submitted pursuant to this Section 3 (rounded down to the nearest whole number), but, in any event, not fewer than two (the greater of such two numbers, the “Maximum Number”). The Maximum Number for a particular annual meeting shall be reduced by: (1) Stockholder Nominees whose nominations are subsequently withdrawn; (2) Stockholder Nominees whom the Board of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such annual meeting; and (3) the number of incumbent directors who had been Stockholder Nominees at any of the preceding two annual meetings of stockholders and whose reelection at the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders is being recommended by the Board of Directors. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the deadline set forth in Section 3(d) but before the date of the annual meeting of stockholders and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.(ii) If the number of Stockholder Nominees pursuant to this Section 3 for any annual meeting of stockholders exceeds the Maximum Number then, promptly upon notice from the Company, each Nominating Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Maximum Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Company’s common stock that each Nominating Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Nomination Notice, with the process repeated if the Maximum Number is not reached after each Nominating Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee. If, after the deadline for submitting a Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 3(d), a Nominating Stockholder becomes ineligible or withdraws its nomination or a Stockholder Nominee becomes ineligible or unwilling to serve on the Board of Directors, whether before or after the mailing of the definitive proxy statement, then9the Company (1) shall not be required to include in its proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy the Stockholder Nominee or any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the Nominating Stockholder or by any other Nominating Stockholder and (2) may otherwise communicate to its stockholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of proxy, that the Stockholder Nominee will not be included as a Stockholder Nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will not be voted on at the annual meeting of stockholders.(c)(i) An “Eligible Stockholder” is a person who has either (1) been a record and beneficial holder of the shares of common stock of the Company used to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 3(c) continuously for the three- year period specified in subsection (c)(ii) of this Section 3 below or (2) provides to the Secretary of the Company, within the time period referred to in Section 3(d), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares for such three-year period from one or more securities intermediaries in a form that the Board of Directors or its designee determines acceptable.(ii)An Eligible Stockholder or group of up to 20 Eligible Stockholders may submit a nomination in accordance with this Section 3 only if the person or group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) (as adjusted for any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or similar events) of shares of the Company’s common stock throughout the three- year period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination Notice, and continues to own at least the Minimum Number of shares through the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. The following shall be treated as one Eligible Stockholder if such Eligible Stockholder shall provide together with satisfactory Nomination Notice documentation that demonstrates compliance with the following criteria: (1) funds under common management and investment control; (2) funds under common management and funded primarily by the same employer; or (3) a “family of investment companies” or a “group of investment companies” (each as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a Nominating Stockholder that includes more than one Eligible Stockholder, any and all requirements and obligations for a given Eligible Stockholder or, except as the context otherwise makes clear, the Nominating Stockholder that are set forth in this Section 3, including the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of such group; provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the aggregate ownership of the group of Eligible Stockholders constituting the Nominating Stockholder. Should any Eligible Stockholder withdraw from a group of Eligible Stockholders constituting a Nominating Stockholder at any time prior to the annual meeting of stockholders, the Nominating Stockholder shall be deemed to own only the shares held by the remaining Eligible Stockholders. As used in this Section 3, any reference to a “group” or “group of Eligible Stockholders” refers to10any Nominating Stockholder that consists of more than one Eligible Stockholder and to all the Eligible Stockholders that make up such Nominating Stockholder.(iii)The “Minimum Number” of shares of the Company’s common stock means 3% of the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the submission of the Nomination Notice.(iv)For purposes of this Section 3, an Eligible Stockholder “owns” only those outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as to which such Eligible Stockholder possesses both: (1) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares and (2) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit from and the risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (1) and (2) shall not include any shares (x) sold by such Eligible Stockholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (y) borrowed by such Eligible Stockholder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Stockholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such Eligible Stockholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding capital stock of the Company, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of: (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such Eligible Stockholder’s or any of its affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree any gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such Eligible Stockholder or any of its affiliates, other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry index fund in which the Company’s common stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. An Eligible Stockholder “owns” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Stockholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Stockholder’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Stockholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the Eligible Stockholder. An Eligible Stockholder’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Stockholder has loaned such shares provided that the Eligible Stockholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on not more than five (5) business days’ notice. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings. For purposes of this Section 3(c)(iv), the term “affiliate”11or “affiliates” shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act.(v)No Eligible Stockholder shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Stockholder, and if any Eligible Stockholder appears as a member of more than one group, such Eligible Stockholder shall be deemed to be a member of only the group that has the largest ownership position as reflected in the Nomination Notice.(d)To nominate a Stockholder Nominee pursuant to this Section 3, the Nominating Stockholder must submit to the Secretary of the Company all of the following information and documents (collectively, the “Nomination Notice”), not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the date that the Company mailed its proxy statement for the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if (and only if) the annual meeting of stockholders is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences 30 days before the first anniversary date of the preceding year’s annual meeting of stockholders and ends 30 days after the first anniversary date of the preceding year’s annual meeting of Stockholders (an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an “Other Meeting Date”), the Nomination Notice shall be given in the manner provided herein by the later of the close of business on the date that is 180 days prior to such Other Meeting Date or the tenth day following the public announcement of the date of such Other Meeting Date (in no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public announcement thereof, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of the Nomination Notice):(i)one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) calendar days prior to the date of the Nomination Notice, the Nominating Stockholder owns, and has continuously owned for the preceding three (3) years, the Minimum Number of shares, and the Nominating Stockholder’s agreement to provide, within five (5) business days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying the Nominating Stockholder’s continuous ownership of the Minimum Number of shares through the record date;(ii)an agreement to provide immediate notice if the Nominating Stockholder ceases to own the Minimum Number of shares at any time prior to the date of the annual meeting;(iii)a copy of the Schedule 14N (or any successor form) relating to the Stockholder Nominee, completed and filed with the Securities and Exchange12Commission by the Nominating Stockholder as applicable, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules;(iv)the written consent of each Stockholder Nominee to being named in the Company’s proxy statement, form of proxy and ballot as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;(v)a written notice of the nomination of such Stockholder Nominee that includes the following additional information, agreements, representations and warranties by the Nominating Stockholder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each group member in the case of a Nominating Stockholder consisting of a group of Eligible Stockholders): (1) the information that would be required to be set forth in a stockholder’s notice of nomination pursuant to Section 2 of this Article II; (2) the details of any relationship that existed within the past three (3) years and that would have been described pursuant to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14N (or any successor item) if it existed on the date of submission of the Schedule 14N;

(3) to assume all liability stemming from an action, suit or proceeding concerning any actual or alleged legal or regulatory violation arising out of any communication by the Nominating Stockholder or the Stockholder Nominee nominated by such Nominating Stockholder with the Company, its stockholders or any other person in connection with the nomination or election of directors, including, without limitation, the Nomination Notice;

In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a special meeting, or the public announcement thereof, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above. Notwithstanding anything in these By‐ Laws to the contrary, in the case of a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, no stockholder may propose to conduct business or nominate a person for election to the Board of Directors at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, except pursuant to Special Meeting Request delivered for such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting.5.Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II shall be properly nominated for election as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these By‐Laws, the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Article II, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article II, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company to present a nomination or other proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded or such proposed business shall not be transacted, as the case may be, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company and counted for17purposes of determining a quorum. For purposes of this Article II, to be considered a “qualified representative” of the stockholder, a person must be duly authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.6.For purposes of this Article II, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.7.Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Article II, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Article II. Nothing in this Article II shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a‐8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of Convertible Preference Stock or Series Preferred Stock if and to the extent provided for under law, the certificate of incorporation or these By‐Laws.8.At each annual or special meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors, at which a quorum is present, each Director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the Director, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a Director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that Director. Any Director standing for reelection at an annual or special meeting of stockholders who is not elected shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results.
