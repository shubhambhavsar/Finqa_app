Results of Review of Interim Financial StatementsWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of S&P Global Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and equity for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedules (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 8, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.Basis for Review ResultsThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion./s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLPNew York, New YorkOctober 24, 20243PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATIONItem 1.

See accompanying notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.9S&P Global Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Unaudited) 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of PresentationS&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “S&P Global,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity and automotive markets.Our operations consist of five reportable segments: S&P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&P Global Ratings (“Ratings”), S&P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&P Global Mobility (“Mobility”) and S&P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”).•Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.•Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.•Commodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.•Mobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies. •Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.As of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of S&P Global Engineering Solutions (“Engineering Solutions”), a provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge, and the results are included through that date.The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, the financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our “Form 10-K”).In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods have been included. The operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Since the date of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.Restricted CashRestricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheets was $1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.Contract AssetsContract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contract assets were $82 million and $75 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. 10Unearned RevenueWe record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The decrease in the unearned revenue balance at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily driven by $3.0 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations.Remaining Performance ObligationsRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $4.1 billion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately sixty percent and eighty-five percent of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter. We do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.Costs to Obtain ContractsWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain contracts were $274 million and $234 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately 5 years. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses.We expense sales commissions when incurred if the benefit of those costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.Equity in Income on Unconsolidated SubsidiariesThe Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combines each company’s post-trade services into a joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME Group’s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company’s MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company's business to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Our share of earnings or losses are recognized in Equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of income.Other Loss (Income), netThe components of other loss (income), net for the periods ended September 30 are as follows:112.

L.P. (“KKR”). We received the full proceeds from the sale of $975 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, which resulted in approximately $750 million in after-tax proceeds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $120 million in (Gain) loss on dispositions, net and disposition-related costs of $16 million in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($182 million after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $157 million) related to the sale of Engineering Solutions.

Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit.In the first quarter of 2023, we received a contingent payment following the sale of Leveraged Commentary and Data (“LCD”) along with a related family of leveraged loan indices in June of 2022. The contingent payment was payable six months following the closing upon the achievement of certain conditions related to the transition of LCD customer relationships. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the contingent payment resulted in a pre-tax gain of $46 million ($34 million after-tax) related to the sale of LCD in our Market Intelligence segment and $4 million ($3 million after-tax) in (Gain) loss on dispositions, net related to the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in our Indices segment.Assets and Liabilities Held for SaleThe components of assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:1 Assets and liabilities held for sale as of September 30, 2024 relate to the anticipated divestiture of the PrimeOne business.The operating profit (loss) of our businesses that were held for sale or disposed of for the periods ended September 30 is as follows:2 The operating profit (loss) presented includes the revenue and recurring direct expenses associated with businesses disposed of or held for sale. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes a pre-tax gain related to the sale of Fincentric of $21 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 excludes a pre-tax loss related to the sale of Engineering Solutions of $120 million.3. Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was 23.0% and 21.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 18.2% and 21.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The lower rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a combination of discrete adjustments and change in the profit mix. The higher rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax charge on divestitures.At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant unusual or infrequently occurring items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect, and are individually computed, is recognized in the interim period in which 13those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs.The Company is subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits was $274 million and $230 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $64 million and $50 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $12 million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.4. Debt A summary of short-term and long-term debt outstanding is as follows:1 We made a $47 million repayment of our 3.625% senior note in the second quarter of 2024.2 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15.3 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1.4 Interest payments are due semiannually on January 22 and July 22, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $2 million.145 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $8 million.6 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 1 and August 1.7 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 1 and November 1. 8 Interest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $3 million.9 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $12 million.10 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $5 million.11 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $24 million.12 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 15 and September 15, beginning on March 15, 2024, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $7 million. 13 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $2 million. 14 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $10 million. 15 Interest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $10 million.16 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $25 million.17 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $17 million.18 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $14 million. The fair value of our total debt borrowings was $10.4 billion and $10.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper. Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.The only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded. 5. Derivative InstrumentsOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2023, we held a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.15Undesignated Derivative InstrumentsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $2.6 billion. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $37 million and $69 million, respectively. The amount recorded in other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $7 million and $1 million, respectively. The amount recorded in selling and general expense related to these contracts was a net gain of $100 million and $54 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a net loss of $82 million and $24 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.Net Investment HedgesDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As of December 31, 2023, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2024, 2029, 2030 and 2032. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $3.5 billion and $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold, liquidated or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of $11 million and $27 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net interest income of $6 million and $18 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.Cash Flow HedgesForeign Exchange Forward Contracts During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the third quarter of 2026 and the fourth quarter of 2025, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within twenty-four months. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that $1 million of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $563 million and $529 million, respectively.Interest Rate SwapsIn the first quarter of 2023, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of $813 million and received net proceeds of $155 million upon termination. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. We performed a final effectiveness test upon the termination of each swap, and the effective portion of the gain of $155 million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our 16consolidated balance sheet. The gain will be recognized into interest expense, net over the term which related interest payments will be made when we enter into anticipated future debt refinancing. The following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:The following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the periods ended September 30:Three MonthsNine Months17The activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the periods ended September 30: 6. Employee Benefits We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.We also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees’ compensation to the employees’ accounts.We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.We recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.Net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other loss (income), net in our consolidated statements of income.18The components of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement plans and postretirement plans for the periods ended September 30 are as follows: Net periodic benefit cost related to our postretirement plans reflected in the table above was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.As discussed in our Form 10-K, we changed certain discount rate assumptions for our retirement and postretirement plans which became effective on January 1, 2024. The effect of the assumption changes on retirement and postretirement expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In the first nine months of 2024, we contributed $7 million to our retirement plans and expect to make additional required contributions of approximately $4 million to our retirement plans during the remainder of the year. We may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance or any potential deterioration of our pension plan status in the fourth quarter of 2024.7. Stock-Based CompensationWe issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and other stock-based awards was $177 million and $143 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 0.4 million shares of restricted stock and other stock-based awards, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of $423.79 per share. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity awards as of September 30, 2024 was $235 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. 8. EquityDividendsOn January 23, 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividends for 2024 to a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.91 per share.Stock RepurchasesOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of September 30, 2024, 14.6 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.We enter into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. 19Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution typically delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as two transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts are classified as equity instruments.The terms of each ASR agreement entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, structured as outlined above, are as follows: 1 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $1.5 billion and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $1.5 billion at a price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on July 31, 2024. The Company received an initial delivery of 2.6 million shares from the ASR program on August 1, 2024. We completed the ASR agreement on October 22, 2024 and received an additional 0.3 million shares. We repurchased a total of 3.0 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price $505.19 per share. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.2 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $500 million and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $500 million at a price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on February 12, 2024 when the Company received an initial delivery of 1.0 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on April 12, 2024 and received an additional 0.2 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.3 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $500 million and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $500 million at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on August 7, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on September 8, 2023 and received an additional 0.2 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.4 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $1 billion and initially received shares valued at 87.5% of the $1 billion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on May 8, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of 2.5 million shares from the ASR program.We completed the ASR agreement on August 4, 2023 and received an additional 0.1 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.5 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $500 million and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $500 million at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on February 13, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on May 5, 2023 and received an additional 0.3 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 4.1 million shares, including 0.2 million shares received in February of 2024 related to our November 13, 2023 ASR agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased a total of 3.8 million shares for $2 billion of cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 5.8 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in February of 2023 related to our December 2, 2022 ASR agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased a total of 5.4 million shares for $2 billion of cash.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsOur redeemable noncontrolling interests include an agreement with the minority partners that own 27% of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture that contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (“CGIS”) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the 15 days following a change in control, CME Group 20and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group’s and CGIS’ minority interest.If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity. Changes to redeemable noncontrolling interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:1 Includes foreign currency translation adjustmentsAccumulated Other Comprehensive LossThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:1Includes an unrealized gain related to our cross currency swaps. See Note 5 – Derivative Instruments for additional detail of items recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 2Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses and is net of a tax benefit of less than $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 6 — Employee Benefits for additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.3See Note 5 — Derivative Instruments for additional details of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.219. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of restricted performance shares and stock options calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the periods ended September 30 is as follows:We have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded when the necessary vesting conditions have not been met or when a net loss exists. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no stock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstanding of 0.9 million and 0.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were excluded.10. RestructuringWe continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2024 and 2023 restructuring plans consisted of a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately 415 and 1,050 positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed.22The initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of September 30, 2024 by segment is as follows:We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $49 million primarily related to employee severance charges for the 2024 restructuring plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and have reduced the reserve by $28 million. The ending reserve balance for the 2023 restructuring plan was $152 million as of December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have reduced the reserve for the 2023 restructuring plan by $115 million. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges.11. Segment and Related Information We have five reportable segments: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices. Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit.

Commitments and Contingencies Leases We determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement. We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 15 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.The following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:The components of lease expense for the periods ended September 30 are as follows: Supplemental information related to leases for the periods ended September 30 are as follows:27Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:Maturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases are as follows: Related Party AgreementsIn June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement") with the holder of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, replacing the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $50 million and $146 million, respectively, of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $43 million and $132 million, respectively, of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the 27% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.Legal and Regulatory MattersIn the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.A class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company. A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by two entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis. We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.From time to time, the Company receives customer complaints. The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers. Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints. The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters.Moreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. On September 3, 2024, as part of an industry-wide investigation into off-channel communications by the SEC, S&P Global Ratings, and certain other NRSROs, reached a settlement to resolve violations of recordkeeping rules. This matter was previously disclosed by S&P Global. In the SEC’s 28order, the SEC recognized S&P Global Ratings’ remedial acts and its cooperation with the SEC staff. As part of the resolution, S&P Global Ratings paid a penalty of $20 million. S&P Global previously accrued that amount in its consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2024. Although S&P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.13. Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting StandardsIn December of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance that expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s disclosures.In November of 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expands reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s disclosures.In March of 2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current contract modifications and hedge accounting guidance in light of the expected market transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to alternative rates. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The transactions primarily include (1) contract modifications, (2) hedging relationships, and (3) sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. In December of 2022, the FASB amended its guidance to defer the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to adopt the amendments prospectively to transactions existing as of or entered into from the date of adoption through December 31, 2024. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 29Item 2.

The increase at Ratings was driven by growth in both transaction revenue and non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a cumulative catch-up for customers’ unreported commercial paper issuance in the third quarter of 2023. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to subscription revenue growth for work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products. Revenue growth at Commodity Insights was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. The increase at Indices was primarily due to higher asset-linked fees revenue, higher data subscription revenue and higher exchange-traded derivative revenue. The increase at Mobility was primarily due to new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business. Revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the sale of Fincentric in August of 2024. Revenue at Commodity Insights was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.Operating profit increased 33%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 7 percentage points, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 5 percentage points and the impact of a gain on disposition in 2024 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of 2 percentage points and a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 20%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and investments in strategic initiatives, and higher technology costs. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.Nine MonthsRevenue increased 14% driven by increases at all of our reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023.

See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.33RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — COMPARING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 Consolidated Review N/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful 34RevenueThe following table provides consolidated revenue information for the periods ended September 30: 35 Three MonthsRevenue increased 16% as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Subscription revenue increased in the three month period primarily due to growth in work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business at Mobility. Subscription revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the sale of Fincentric in August of 2024. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a cumulative catch-up for customers’ unreported commercial paper issuance in the third quarter of 2023. Asset linked fees increased at Indices primarily due to higher levels of assets under management (“AUM”) for ETFs and mutual funds. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to increased volumes. See “Segment Review” below for further information. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.Nine MonthsRevenue increased 14% as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Subscription revenue increased in the nine month period primarily due to growth in work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business at Mobility, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023.

Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to increased volumes. See “Segment Review” below for further information. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.

The lower rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a combination of discrete adjustments and change in the profit mix. The higher rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax charge on divestitures.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory matters see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q. Ratings Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and•bank loan ratings.Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue was $41 million and $120 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $38 million and $113 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.45The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the periods ended September 30:1Operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment of $6 million.

Three MonthsRevenue increased 36%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a cumulative catch-up for customers’ unreported commercial paper issuance in the third quarter of 2023. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. Operating profit increased 47%. Excluding the impact of a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 48% due to revenue growth. This growth was partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.Nine MonthsRevenue increased 33%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased CLOs issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a cumulative catch-up for customers’ unreported commercial paper issuance in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. Operating profit increased 46%. Excluding the impact of legal costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point the impact of a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 48% due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.46Billed Issuance VolumesWe monitor billed issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Billed issuance excludes items that do not impact transaction revenue, such as issuance from frequent issuer programs, unrated debt, and most international public finance to more effectively correlate issuance activity to movements in transaction revenue. The following table provides billed issuance levels based on Ratings’ internal data feeds for the periods ended September 30:Note - Totals presented may not sum due to rounding.* Includes Corporates, Financial Services and Infrastructure.** Includes Bank Loans, Structured Finance and Government. Third quarter billed issuance was up as continued favorable market conditions drove issuers to capitalize on tightening borrowing spreads. Refinancing continued to drive high-yield, while M&A and other non-refinancing activity drove billed issuance increases in investment grade and bank loans. Structured finance billed issuance increases were driven primarily by new CLO issuance.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses. Cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.Cash Flow OverviewCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1,697 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $406 million from December 31, 2023.The following table provides cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30: N/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningfulIn the first nine months of 2024, free cash flow increased $1,575 million to $3,645 million compared to $2,070 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities as discussed 52below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.Operating activitiesCash provided by operating activities increased $1,573 million to $3,949 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results, higher cash collections and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2024.Investing activities Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.Cash used for investing activities was $262 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $607 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received in 2023 related to the disposition of Engineering Solutions. See Note 2 — Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion.Financing activitiesOur cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt.Cash used for financing activities increased $678 million to $3,280 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the $750 million issuance of senior note in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased a total of 3.8 million shares for $2 billion of cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased a total of 5.4 million shares for $2 billion of cash. See Note 8 — Equity to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion.Additional FinancingWe have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion 5-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no commercial paper outstanding.Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.The only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded. DividendsOn January 23, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.91 per share.

This summarized financial information excludes the Non-Obligor Group. Intercompany balances and transactions between members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. This information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Summarized results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2024 are as follows: 54Summarized balance sheet information as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. We believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30: N/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful55CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 — Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in our most recent Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our most recent Form 10-K, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. These critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable non-controlling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Since the date of our most recent Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates.RECENTLY ISSUED OR ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 13 – Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further information.56FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report contains “forward-looking statements,” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include, among other things:•worldwide economic, financial, political, and regulatory conditions (including slower GDP growth or recession, instability in the banking sector and inflation), and factors that contribute to uncertainty and volatility, natural and man-made disasters, civil unrest, public health crises (e.g., pandemics), geopolitical uncertainty (including military conflict), and conditions that may result from legislative, regulatory, trade and policy changes;•the volatility and health of debt, equity, commodities, energy and automotive markets, including credit quality and spreads, the level of liquidity and future debt issuances, demand for investment products that track indices and assessments and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives;•the demand and market for credit ratings in and across the sectors and geographies where the Company operates;•the Company’s ability to maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of confidential information and data, and the potential for a system or network disruption that results in regulatory penalties and remedial costs or improper disclosure of confidential information or data;•the outcome of litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries;•concerns in the marketplace affecting the Company’s credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the integrity or utility of independent credit ratings, benchmarks, indices and other services;•our ability to attract, incentivize and retain key employees, especially in a competitive business environment;•the Company’s exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil penalties for noncompliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including sanctions laws relating to countries such as Iran, Russia and Venezuela, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, as well as import and export restrictions;•the continuously evolving regulatory environment in Europe, the United States and elsewhere around the globe affecting each of our businesses and the products they offer, and our compliance therewith;•the Company’s ability to make acquisitions and dispositions and successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;•consolidation of the Company’s customers, suppliers or competitors;•the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies;•our ability to develop new products or technologies, to integrate our products with new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence), or to compete with new products or technologies offered by new or existing competitors;•the effect of competitive products and pricing, including the level of success of new product developments and global expansion;•the impact of customer cost-cutting pressures;•a decline in the demand for our products and services by our customers and other market participants;•the ability of the Company, and its third-party service providers, to maintain adequate physical and technological infrastructure;•the Company’s ability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, civil unrest, protests, military conflict, terrorist attack, outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases, security breach, cyber attack, data breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event;•the level of merger and acquisition activity in the United States and abroad;•the level of the Company’s future cash flows and capital investments;•the impact on the Company’s revenue and net income caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and•the impact of changes in applicable tax or accounting requirements on the Company.The factors noted above are not exhaustive. The Company and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks emerge frequently. Accordingly, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it is made, except as 57required by applicable law. Further information about the Company’s businesses, including information about factors that could materially affect its results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Item 1A, Risk Factors in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.58Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.The following table provides information on our purchases of our outstanding common stock during the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to the 2022 Repurchase Program (column c).
