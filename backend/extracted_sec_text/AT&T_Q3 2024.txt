(ii)If (x) AT&T does not object to Buyer’s proposed Closing Statement by delivering a written notice of objection (a “Notice of Objection”) to Buyer within 60 days following delivery thereof to AT&T (the “Objection Period”) or (y) AT&T has accepted Buyer’s proposed Closing Statement in writing, Buyer’s calculations, including the calculation of the Closing Upfront Consideration and the Closing Blocker Liability Amount set forth in the Closing Statement, shall be deemed final and binding. The Notice of Objection delivered within the Objection Period pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(ii) shall set forth AT&T’s objections to the Closing Statement in reasonable detail with supporting materials together with an alternative Closing Statement, as applicable. During the Objection Period, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall provide reasonable access to all reasonably relevant personnel, books and records and other financial information (subject to execution of any customary work paper access letters required by them), in each case, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, required by AT&T for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement and preparing a Notice of Objection; provided, that Buyer shall not be required to provide access to any information that is subject to an attorney-client or an attorney work-product privilege. (iii)If AT&T delivers a Notice of Objection to Buyer within the Objection Period, then any element of Buyer’s proposed Closing Statement that is not in dispute 4under such Notice of Objection at the expiration of the Objection Period shall be deemed final and binding for purposes of this Section 2.3. Any disputed elements of the proposed Closing Statement (“Disputed Adjustment Amounts”) shall be resolved as set forth in this Section 2.3(b)(iii). (A)The Parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the Disputed Adjustment Amounts listed in such Notice of Objection.

AT&T and Buyer shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accounting Expert for its engagement hereunder.(B)Within 30 days of the submission of all documentation with respect to the Notice of Objection to the Accounting Expert, the Accounting Expert shall render a decision regarding the Disputed Adjustment Amounts in accordance with this Section 2.3(b)(iii)(B). In making such decision, the Accounting Expert shall be bound by this Agreement, shall only resolve the Disputed Adjustment Amounts, shall make all adjustments regardless of materiality and shall not assign a value to any such Disputed Adjustment Amount outside the range of values assigned to such Disputed Adjustment Amount in the Closing Statement and the Notice of Objection, respectively. The Accounting Expert shall not conduct an independent investigation but shall instead base its determination on the written submissions of the Parties delivered pursuant to this Section 2.3 with respect to the Disputed Adjustment Amounts. (C)The Accounting Expert’s resolution of the Disputed Adjustment Amounts and its adjustments to the Closing Statement, the Closing Upfront Consideration, and the Closing Blocker Liability Amount set forth therein shall, in the absence of fraud or manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.3. The Accounting Expert shall act as an expert, and not as an arbitrator, for the limited purpose of determining the resolution of the Disputed Adjustment Amounts and adjustments to the Closing Statement, the Closing Upfront Consideration, and the Closing Blocker Liability Amount and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. The Accounting Expert, once appointed, shall have no ex 5parte communications with the Parties concerning the Disputed Adjustment Amounts. All communications between any Party and the Accounting Expert shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Parties in writing. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be allocated between Buyer and AT&T based upon the percentage of the contested amount submitted to the Accounting Expert that is ultimately awarded to Buyer on the one hand or AT&T on the other hand, such that Buyer bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to AT&T, and AT&T bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Buyer. (D)The Closing Upfront Consideration and the Closing Blocker Liability Amount shall be recalculated based upon the final determination (or deemed determination) of the Accounting Expert with respect to the Disputed Adjustment Amounts, and the Final Upfront Consideration and the Final Blocker Liability Amount, as so recalculated, shall be deemed to be conclusive and binding on the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.3. (iv)Within five Business Days following the final determination of the Final Upfront Consideration in accordance with Section 2.3(b)(ii) or Section 2.3(b)(iii):(A)if the Estimated Upfront Consideration exceeds the Final Upfront Consideration, AT&T shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer the absolute value of the difference between the Final Upfront Consideration and the Estimated Upfront Consideration (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by Buyer to AT&T); (B)if the Final Upfront Consideration equals the Estimated Upfront Consideration, then no adjustment to the Estimated Upfront Consideration shall be made and neither AT&T nor Buyer shall pay any amounts to the other pursuant to this Section 2.3(b); or (C)if the Final Upfront Consideration exceeds the Estimated Upfront Consideration, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to AT&T the absolute value of the difference between the Final Upfront Consideration and the Estimated Upfront Consideration (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by AT&T to Buyer). (c)Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, other than with respect to Fraud claims, the process set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties for any disputes related to items required to be included or reflected in the calculation of the Final Upfront Consideration and the Final Blocker Liability Amount. No Buyer Indemnified Party may recover Losses under ARTICLE VIII to the extent such Losses are specifically taken into account in the calculation of the Final Upfront Consideration or the Final Blocker Liability Amount pursuant to this Section 2.3. 6Section II.4Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Parties and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable hereunder or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any payments made under the Seller Note, the withholding obligations with respect to which will be solely governed by the terms of the Seller Note) the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, territory, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. Buyer, AT&T or the applicable withholding agent, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide prior written notice to the other Party prior to any deduction or withholding pursuant to this Section 2.4 to provide a reasonable opportunity to avoid such deductions and withholding (other than in the case of compensatory payments to employees). Any amounts so withheld shall be timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.ARTICLE IIICLOSINGSection III.1Closing.
