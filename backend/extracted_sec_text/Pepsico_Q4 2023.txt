The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.4Table of ContentsDirect-Store-DeliveryWe, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.Customer WarehouseSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.Distributor NetworksWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.E-commerceOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.Ingredients and Other SuppliesThe principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are acesulfame potassium, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, juice concentrates, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. During 2023, we continued to experience increased commodity, packaging and other input costs and, in some instances, supply constraints related to the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which may continue into fiscal 2024. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.5Table of ContentsWe also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements did not have a material impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Our Brands and Intellectual Property RightsWe own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Arto Lifewtr, Baja Blast, BaiCaoWei, Bare, Bokomo, Bubly, Cap’n Crunch, Ceres, Cheetos, Chester’s, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Driftwell, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Evolve, Fast Twitch, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Gatorade Fit, Gatorade Zero, Gatorlyte, Grandma’s, H2oh!, Hard MTN Dew, Health Warrior, Imunele, J7, Kas, Kurkure, Lay’s, Life, Lifewtr, Liquifruit, Lubimyj Sad, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie’s, Moirs, Mother’s, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Game Fuel, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, MTN Dew Energy, Mug, Munchies, Muscle Milk, Near East, Off the Eaten Path, Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pearl Milling Company, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar, PopCorners, Pronutro, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Quaker Simply Granola, Rice-A-Roni, Rockstar Energy, Rold Gold, Ruffles, Sabritas, Safari, Sakata, Saladitas Gamesa, San Carlos, Sandora, Santitas, Sasko, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Simba, Smartfood, Smith’s, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonric’s, Spekko, Stacy’s, Starry, Starry Zero Sugar, Sting, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers, Weetbix, White Star, Ya and Yachak. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute Celsius energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2022, we began to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company. We have licensed the use of the Hard MTN Dew trademark to the Boston Beer Company, which has appointed us as their distributor for this product. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.SeasonalityOur businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.6Table of ContentsOur CustomersOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2023, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.Our CompetitionOur beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellanova, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.Many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2023, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 19% and 20%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.7Table of ContentsOur beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.Research and DevelopmentWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve: innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes, including reductions in cost and environmental footprint; implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including legumes, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, dairy, protein (including plant-based proteins), fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable, reusable or otherwise sustainable packaging; development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research; continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our environmental impact in our operations throughout our value chain.Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods.Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety and food labeling; the Food Safety 8Table of ContentsModernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health and safety; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act and various state law statutory and common law duties regarding false advertising; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act and the Clayton Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; various state and federal laws pertaining to sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act); customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating the ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chains, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.Certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.Certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold, limit the location in which our products may be available or discontinue the use of certain ingredients. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. 9Table of ContentsCertain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates, encourage waste reduction, restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging or to carry warnings about the environmental impact of plastic packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, we are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities. Our operations outside the United States are subject to similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce emissions to mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses or properties acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Human CapitalPepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is critical to our long-term success. Our Board of Directors (Board) and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity, health and safety, training and development and compensation and benefits. We employed approximately 318,000 people worldwide as of December 30, 2023, including approximately 134,000 people within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our employees are generally good. Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’s top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emerging technologies to protect our employees from injuries, including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology, resulting in reductions in road traffic incidents, and deploying ergonomic and machine safety risk reduction solutions.10Table of ContentsWe believe that our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continually strive to improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we serve. As of December 30, 2023, our global workforce was approximately 27% female, while management roles were approximately 45% female. As of December 30, 2023, approximately 49% of our U.S. workforce was comprised of racially/ethnically diverse individuals, of which approximately 34% of our U.S. associates in managerial roles were racially/ethnically diverse individuals. The Board has overseen appointments of current direct reports of our Chief Executive Officer, who include 7 executives globally who are racially/ethnically diverse and/or female.We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our internal global online learning resource. In 2023, PepsiCo employees completed over 1.5 million hours of training.Available InformationWe are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future. Business RisksRisks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine The deadly conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions have continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our 11Table of Contentsinformation systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets, including the nationalization or expropriation of assets, result in additional impairment charges or significantly affect our ability to manage our operations in these markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers, consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business.Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns, diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, the use of weight-loss drugs or other factors) and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, and geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events. These and other factors have reduced and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products, including as a result of public boycotts. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues.Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us, our business partners, or other actors in the supply chain to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure, or 12Table of Contentsperception of a failure, to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, or any negative perception toward such goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health or other concerns about our products, products we distribute (including alcoholic beverages), or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity and other health conditions or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.We have recalled, and could in the future recall, products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Joint ventures in which we have an interest have also recalled, and could in the future recall, products for the same or other reasons. Product recalls, including the voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals in our QFNA division (Quaker Recall), have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory, customer fines and returns or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, including as a result of temporary or permanent closure of manufacturing plants or facilities, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments, cleaning and remediation costs and legal fees, and costs associated with alternative sources of production) and damage our reputation (or the reputation of joint ventures in which we have an interest), particularly as we or our joint ventures continue to expand into new categories, all of which can adversely affect our business. Any perception or allegation (whether or not valid) of failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of product recalls, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business.Our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to 13Table of Contentsanticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively or effectively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures.Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce can have an adverse effect on our business. Our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and changing worker expectations regarding flexible work models. Any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.Water scarcity can adversely affect our business.We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, actions by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, can lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; increased capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business.Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business.The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow 14Table of Contentstheir businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result of increased consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America. In this changing retail landscape, retailers and buying groups have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions by demanding lower prices or increased promotional programs, removing our products or otherwise reducing shelf space allocated to our products. The increasing power of retailers and consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Our inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers has adversely affected and can continue to adversely affect our business. Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.We have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing war and other military conflict, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions also pose physical risks to our facilities, which could impair our production capabilities and disrupt our supply chain. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to mitigate disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products or from operational or financial instability of our key suppliers. Any sustained or significant disruption in the future to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19), labor shortages or changes in availability of our or our business partners’ workforce (including the lack of availability of truck drivers as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages (including by railway workers or other third parties involved in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products), governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We continued to experience 15Table of Contentsincreased commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2023, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.Political, social and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business.Political, social and geopolitical conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns), geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the United States as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections, civil rights and liberties and geopolitical events. Our operations or the operations of our business partners, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, regulation, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; geopolitical conflicts, acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets. 16Table of ContentsChanges in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as high inflation and adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates, including as a result of geopolitical events. These uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in recessions or economic slowdowns; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business.We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may increase our cybersecurity risks, including generative artificial intelligence augmenting threat actors’ technological sophistication to enhance existing or create new malware. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. Continued geopolitical instability has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following: transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, 17Table of Contentsintellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers. In addition, these risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems.Similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of various business processes and activities, including procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, information technology support services and administrative functions (including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions) and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware and exploit known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to address issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we believe we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and data protection and cybersecurity) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; recognition of impairment charges in connection with potential divestitures; managing the impact of business 18Table of Contentsdecisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business.Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business.We rely on third-party service providers, including software and cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, information technology support services and administrative functions (such as payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions). Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have deployed these systems in certain countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected.Climate change or measures to address climate change and other sustainability matters can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation.Climate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions, including rising temperatures and drought. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, climate change or other weather-related disruptions to our supply chain may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, working toward achieving our sustainability goals will require significant effort and resources from us and other stakeholders, such as our suppliers and other third parties, governmental entities, and the development of technology that may not currently exist or exist at scale. Lack of progress or failure to properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on 19Table of Contentsthe environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change and other sustainability matters, including the use of single-use plastics, can lead to adverse publicity, which could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation, regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer.Many of our employees and employees of third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production or distribution of our products are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we or the third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, interrupt product supply, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business.Financial RisksFailure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance.Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance.A deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business or investments can result in impairment charges that adversely affect our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable intangible assets, equity method investments, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments in available-for-sale debt securities, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. Our equity method investees also perform similar impairment tests and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them, adjusted for the impact of items such as basis differences and deferred taxes, as appropriate. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions, or those of our equity method investees, regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, geopolitical conditions (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), macroeconomic conditions, including the interest rate environment, or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, as well as our ability to hold the investment until recovery of fair value to amortized cost for available-for-sale debt securities, have resulted and could in the future result in an impairment charge, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.20Table of ContentsFluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions or geopolitical instability have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance. Legal, Tax and Regulatory RisksTaxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Romania enacted a graduated tax on all non-alcoholic beverages, effective January 1, 2024, at a rate of 0.4 Romanian Leu (0.09 U.S. dollars) per liter for drinks with a sugar content between 5-8g per 100ml and 0.6 Romanian Leu (0.13 U.S. dollars) per liter for drinks with a sugar content between above 8g per 100ml. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance.Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products or product packaging. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product or product packaging, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold, limit the location in which our products may be available or discontinue the use of certain ingredients or packaging. For 21Table of Contentsexample, Colombia enacted warning labeling requirements effective in 2023 to indicate whether a particular pre-packaged food product contains any amount of sweeteners or is considered to be high in added sugar, sodium, saturated fat or trans-fat. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past reduced and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance.We rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. However, not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure, improper disposal or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation, government investigations or other action or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws, regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction, increased recycling rates or decreased use of single-use plastics or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These laws, regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, minimum recycled content requirements, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing PFAS, restrictions on labeling related to recyclability, requirements to charge deposit fees and requirements to scale reusable or refillable packaging. For example, the European Union, Peru, South Africa and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past increased and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or other materials used in our packaging, to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance.Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business.We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, as well as comprehensive privacy legislation in Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut that became effective in 2023, as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law) and China’s Personal Information Protection Act, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions continue to adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from 22Table of Contentsunauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business.Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance.Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation. For example, numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development model (OECD) rules that propose a partial global profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Certain countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation incorporating the global minimum tax with effect as early as 2024 and widespread implementation of a global minimum tax is expected by 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected.We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. Such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business. The conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, supply chain, traceability, sourcing (including pesticide use), packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental, social and governance matters and reporting (including climate change), machine learning and artificial intelligence and data privacy and 23Table of Contentsprotection. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition and antitrust laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements, including expanded disclosure requirements that are expected to continue to expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters on which we are required to report. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations (or allegations thereof) can subject us to criminal or civil investigations or enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business.Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business.We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters, including concerns or perceptions regarding our packaging and its environmental impact, and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2023 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.Item 1C. Cybersecurity.Cybersecurity Risk Management and StrategyWe are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. In response, we have implemented cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our efforts to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks. Our enterprise risk management framework considers cybersecurity risk alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process. Our enterprise risk management team collaborates with our Information Security function, led by the Company’s Chief Strategy and 24Table of ContentsTransformation Officer and the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer, to gather insights for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threat risks, their severity, and potential mitigations. We assess PepsiCo’s Information Security program using an industry-leading cybersecurity framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. To help assess and identify our cybersecurity risks, we maintain internal resources to perform penetration testing designed to simulate evolving tactics and techniques of real-world threat actors, engage with industry partners and law enforcement and intelligence communities and conduct tabletop exercises and periodic risk interviews across our business. We also engage an independent third party to perform internal and external penetration testing of PepsiCo’s environment periodically and engage other third parties to periodically conduct assessments of our cybersecurity capabilities. In addition, we continue to expand training and awareness practices to mitigate human risk, including mandatory computer-based training, internal communications, and regular phishing awareness campaigns that are designed to emulate real-world contemporary threats and provide immediate feedback (and, if necessary, additional training or remedial action) to employees. Our processes also address cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers. We proactively evaluate the cybersecurity risk of a third party by utilizing a repository of risk assessments, external monitoring sources, threat intelligence and predictive analytics to better inform PepsiCo during contracting and vendor selection processes. Additionally, when third party risks are identified, we require those third parties to agree by contract to implement appropriate security controls. Security issues are documented and tracked and periodic monitoring is conducted for third parties in order to mitigate risk. In addition to the processes, technologies, and controls that we have in place to reduce the likelihood of a successful material cyberattack, the Company has established well-defined response procedures to address cyber events that do occur. The program provides for the coordination of various corporate functions and governance groups and serves as a framework for the execution of responsibilities across businesses and operational roles. Our incident response plan coordinates the activities we take to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to triage, assess severity for, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate the incident, as well as to assess for potential disclosure, comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage. We also maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures.Based on the information we have as of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about these risks.Cybersecurity GovernanceCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In 2021, the Board amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines to specifically mention cybersecurity as an area of Board oversight to reflect this existing practice. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management, including from the Company’s Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer, regarding cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity, results from third-party assessments, and also discusses any significant cyber incidents, including recent incidents at other companies and the emerging threat landscape.25Table of ContentsOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, which are discussed in greater detail above, are led by the Company’s Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer. Such individuals have significant prior work experience in various roles across multiple industries involving managing information security, developing cybersecurity strategy, implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs and managing compliance environments. These members of management are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan.Item 2. Properties.Our principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties.In connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing, bottling and production plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased. Significant properties by division are as follows: (a)The land on which these properties are located is leased.Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations.26Table of ContentsItem 3. Legal Proceedings.On November 15, 2023, the People of the State of New York filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo, Inc., Frito-Lay, Inc. and Frito-Lay North America, Inc. (the NYS Matter) asserting claims for public nuisance, deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of business, and failure to warn that our packaging was a potential source of plastic pollution, allegedly resulting in plastic pollution in the Buffalo River. This matter is pending in the Commercial Division of the New York State Supreme Court – Erie County. The lawsuit does not specify the amount of damages sought and we believe we have strong defenses to each of these claims. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of the NYS Matter and each such other litigation, claim, legal or regulatory proceeding, inquiry and investigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.Not applicable.

For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to 2021 and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.OUR BUSINESSExecutive OverviewPepsiCo is a leading global convenient food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.As a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2023 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; ongoing climate issues; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; and an evolving regulatory landscape.To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value, while inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations, and can be seen in such efforts as sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day, to driving positive change across our value chain and inspiring people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars:Positive Agriculture: We are working to expand and share regenerative practices across seven million acres (approximately equal to the company’s agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. Understanding that scale and collaboration are essential to achieve these goals, in 2023, we expanded our partnership approach with new programs aimed at accelerating regenerative agriculture. This included a $120 million investment with Walmart to support regenerative agriculture on more than two million acres of farmland in the United States and Canada and a $216 million investment with three of the most well-respected farmer-facing organizations—Practical Farmers of Iowa, the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund and the Illinois Corn Growers Association—to help drive adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across the United States. Technology is also a key enabler. Through the third year of our Positive Agriculture Outcomes Accelerator, we invested in a variety of practical advancements with farmers across the globe, including weather stations in Pakistan, on-farm water analysis in Iraq and sprinkler irrigation systems in Colombia. 32Table of ContentsWe have continued developing new solutions, such as fertilizer produced from green hydrogen through a partnership with Fertiberia in Spain, aiming to reduce emissions by 15% in potato crops. And through innovations such as Agroscout, which combines artificial intelligence and drone technology, we are able to identify crop diseases more efficiently, reducing pesticide use and improving crop yields. Positive Value Chain: We are working to help build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions aiming to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using more recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our reusable packaging offerings by 2030.As we work to decarbonize our operations, alongside growing our use of electric and alternative low emission fuel vehicles, in 2023 we opened our first biomethane plant at our foods site in Manisa, Turkey, converting dried corn husks and potato peelings into biogas. We are also embedding pep+ into our new facilities, including our $320 million manufacturing facility in Poland. To support our customers on their sustainability journey, we launched pep+ Partners for Tomorrow in the United States to share training and initiatives on one platform. We are focused on reducing virgin plastic through new launches of bottles made with recycled plastic in India and the United Arab Emirates, while also expanding paper options, such as our Quaker pots and Walkers multipacks in the United Kingdom. In December 2023, Walkers Sunbites announced the introduction of new packaging made with 50% recycled plastic. Through 2023, we continued to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including the iconic SodaStream, already sold in more than 40 countries. We also offer returnable bottles in Mexico and Spain and are engaged in reusable cup pilots, including in the United States.We are also making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey around the world. And we continue to empower each of our approximately 318,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a Time.Positive Choices: We continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food and beverage products so they continue to be positive for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing products, prioritizing legumes, plant-based proteins, whole grains and fruits and vegetables; expanding our position in the nuts and seeds category; accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio; and cooking our food offerings with healthier oils. In 2023, we announced two new ambitious nutrition goals, which aim to further reduce sodium and purposefully deliver 145 billion portions of diverse ingredients annually by 2030. We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.Our OperationsSee “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition, research and development, regulatory matters and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas. Other RelationshipsCertain members of our Board also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our 33Table of Contentstransactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.Our Business RisksRisks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply ChainDuring 2023, we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which may continue in 2024. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability and costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.Risks Associated with Climate ChangeCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.Risks Associated with International OperationsWe are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, geopolitical conflicts, acts of war, terrorist acts, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recognized in the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in UkraineIn addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The conflict and related sanctions imposed on Russia by 34Table of Contentsthe United States and others has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and has impacted our operations in Ukraine and Russia. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. Our operations in Russia accounted for 4% and 5% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Russia accounted for 3% and 4% of our consolidated assets and 35% and 32% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for 0.3% and 0.2% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Ukraine accounted for 0.1% of our consolidated assets as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets, including the nationalization or expropriation of assets, result in additional impairment charges or significantly affect our ability to manage our operations in these markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or impact our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022.The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflict, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our ProductsCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of 35Table of Contentspackaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.OECD Global Minimum TaxNumerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the OECD model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Certain countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation incorporating the agreed to global minimum tax with effect as early as 2024, and widespread implementation of a global minimum tax is expected as soon as 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.Retail LandscapeOur industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.The retail industry also continues to be impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America. We have seen and expect to continue to see retailers and buying groups impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions. We continue to monitor our relationships with retailers and buying groups and seek to identify actions we may take to maintain mutually beneficial relationships and resolve any significant disputes and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:•PepsiCo’s Board has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. Throughout the year, the Board and relevant Committees of the Board receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk 36Table of Contentsmanagement issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater detail, including risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, human capital management (including diversity, equity and inclusion) and supply chain and commodity inflation. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding the Company’s top risks, including updates from members of management responsible for overseeing impacted areas (for example, the Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and Chief Information Security Officer), governance processes associated with managing these risks, the status of projects to strengthen the Company’s risk mitigation efforts and recent incidents impacting the industry and threat landscape. Given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider short-, medium- and long-term potential impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers and emerging trends, and considers the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Company’s risk mitigation efforts. The Board receives updates through presentations, memos and other written materials, teleconferences and other appropriate means of communication, with numerous opportunities for discussion and feedback, and continuously evaluates its approach in addressing top risks as circumstances evolve. For example, as part of risk updates to the Board and relevant Committees during 2023, the Board or its relevant Committee were provided updates on the impact of disruptive events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain disruption and commodity inflation. The Board also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and conditions that may impact the Company’s strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, labor market trends, changing consumer behavior, retail disruption and digitalization.The Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.◦The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo. The Audit Committee also assists the Board’s oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, who reports to the General Counsel, meets regularly with the Audit Committee, including in executive session without management present; ◦The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; ◦The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and◦The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters. •The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC) meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also 37Table of Contentsresponsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board and designated Committees. The PRC is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Sector Chief Executive Officers and the heads of Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Research & Development, Information Technology, Sustainability, Strategy, Transformation, International Beverages, Commercial, Global Operations, Marketing and Financial Planning & Analysis;•Division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;•PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;•PepsiCo’s Internal Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and•PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.•PepsiCo’s Disclosure Committee, comprised of the General Counsel, Controller and heads of Internal Audit, Financial Planning & Analysis and Investor Relations, evaluates information from PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework as part of the Disclosure Committee’s monitoring of the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. PepsiCo’s risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.Market RisksWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:•commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and•interest rates.In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is impacted by changes in market conditions, including interest rates and inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies and 38Table of ContentsEstimates” for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intangible assets and pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.Commodity PricesOur commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.7 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. At the end of 2023, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2023 by $157 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.Foreign ExchangeOur operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue in 2023, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 25% of our consolidated net revenue in 2023. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2023, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Russian ruble and Egyptian pound, partially offset by an appreciation of the Mexican peso. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.8 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. At the end of 2023, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2023 by $371 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $3.0 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. Interest RatesOur interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Assuming year-end 2023 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2023 by $57 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.39Table of ContentsOUR FINANCIAL RESULTSResults of Operations — Consolidated ReviewVolume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Further, our fiscal 2022 results include an additional week (53rd reporting week). Unit volume growth excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week from 2022 results.Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks.Convenient food volume includes volume sold by us and our noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating ProfitSee “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit grew 4% while operating margin declined 0.2 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing, productivity savings, an 11-percentage-point favorable impact of prior-year charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and a 5-percentage-point favorable impact of prior-year impairment on intangible assets, investment and property, plant and equipment and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/40Table of Contentsdistribution of certain brands and to sell an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges). These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 26-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction, a 22-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, a decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Corporate unallocated expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to our ongoing business initiatives and higher contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. to fund charitable and social programs. The 53rd reporting week in the prior year reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point.The operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction partially offset by the prior-year charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges.Other Consolidated Results Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $118 million, primarily reflecting prior-year settlement charges of $318 million related to U.S. defined benefit plans. In addition, the increase in other pension and retiree medical benefits income reflects lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and a higher rate of expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates.Net interest expense and other decreased $120 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances, gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability and higher average cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt and higher average debt balances.The reported tax rate increased 3.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 to 2016 audit as well as the prior-year impact of the Juice Transaction.Results of Operations — Division ReviewSee “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.41Table of ContentsNet Revenue and Organic Revenue GrowthOrganic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on this measure, see “Non-GAAP Measures.”(a)Amounts may not sum due to rounding.(b)Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the 53rd reporting week. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.(c)Net revenue decline was impacted by product returns related to the Quaker Recall by 2 percentage points, as well as cessation of sales of products as a result of the Quaker Recall.Operating Profit/(Loss), Operating Profit/(Loss) Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit/(Loss) Performance Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency BasisOperating profit/(loss) adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit/(loss) performance adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures. For further information on these measures, see “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability.”Operating Profit/(Loss) and Operating Profit/(Loss) Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability42Table of Contents(a)See “Items Affecting Comparability.”Operating Profit/(Loss) Performance and Operating Profit/(Loss) Performance Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis(a)See “Items Affecting Comparability.”(b)Amounts may not sum due to rounding.n/m - Not meaningful due to the impact of impairment and other charges, resulting in an operating loss in 2022.FLNANet revenue grew 7%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by the impact of the 53rd reporting week in the prior year, which reduced net revenue by 2 percentage points. Unit volume decreased 1%, primarily driven by a high-single-digit decline in dips, a mid-single-digit decline in trademark Tostitos and a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’s, partially offset by double-digit growth in Sunchips and mid-single-digit growth in trademark Cheetos. Operating profit increased 10%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing, productivity savings and a 2-percentage-point favorable impact of prior-year impairment charges associated with a baked fruit convenient food brand. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, and a 10-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, seasoning ingredients and potatoes. The 53rd reporting week in the prior year reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.43Table of ContentsQFNANet revenue declined 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in organic volume and a 2-percentage-point negative impact of the 53rd reporting week in the prior year, partially offset by effective net pricing. The organic volume decline and effective net pricing collectively included a 2-percentage-point negative impact of the product returns from the Quaker Recall and was negatively impacted by cessation of sales of products as a result of the Quaker Recall.Unit volume declined 5% primarily reflecting a high-single-digit decline in oatmeal, a double-digit decline in bars, a high-single-digit decline in rice/pasta sides and a low-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals. The unit volume decline in bars and ready-to-eat cereals was negatively impacted by the Quaker Recall. Operating profit declined 19%, reflecting a 22-percentage-point impact of product returns and charges associated with the Quaker Recall, certain operating cost increases, the decrease in organic volume, a 9-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the 53rd reporting week in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings.In 2024, unit volume, net revenue and operating profit will continue to be negatively impacted by the Quaker Recall due to lower sales and additional charges.PBNANet revenue increased 5%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. The 53rd reporting week in the prior year reduced net revenue growth by 1.5 percentage points.Unit volume decreased 5%, driven by a 6% decrease in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a 4% decrease in CSD volume. The NCB volume decrease primarily reflected high-single-digit decreases in Gatorade sports drinks and our overall water portfolio. Operating profit decreased 52%, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain of $3.0 billion associated with the Juice Transaction and the current-year impairment charges of $321 million related to our TBG investment, partially offset by the prior-year impairment and other related charges of $160 million associated with our decision to terminate the agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to distribute Bang energy drinks. Operating profit also decreased due to certain operating cost increases, the decrease in organic volume, an 18-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily sweeteners and energy, a 5-percentage-point unfavorable impact due to a prior-year gain on an asset sale and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, operating profit performance reflects a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the 53rd reporting week in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings.LatAmNet revenue increased 19%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and a 9-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a net organic volume decline.Convenient foods unit volume declined 4%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in Colombia. Additionally, Mexico and Brazil experienced low-single-digit declines.Beverage unit volume grew 3%, primarily reflecting low-single-digit growth in Mexico and mid-single-digit growth in Guatemala and Colombia, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Argentina. Additionally, Chile experienced slight growth and Brazil experienced low-single-digit growth.Operating profit increased 38%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing, productivity savings, a 13-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange and a 6-percentage-point favorable impact of a 44Table of Contentsprior-year impairment and other charges associated with the sale of certain non-strategic brands. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, the net organic volume decline, an 11-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily potatoes, sweeteners and other ingredients and higher advertising and marketing expenses. EuropeNet revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by an 8-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and an organic volume decline.Convenient foods unit volume decreased slightly, primarily reflecting a high-single-digit decline in the United Kingdom, a double-digit decline in Spain, a mid-single-digit decline in France and a low-single-digit decline in the Netherlands, partially offset by double-digit growth in Russia and high-single-digit growth in Turkey.Beverage unit volume declined 3%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in Germany, a high-single-digit decline in France and a low-single-digit decline in Russia, partially offset by double-digit growth in Turkey. Additionally, the United Kingdom experienced a low-single-digit decline.Operating profit improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of prior-year charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and impairment of intangible assets related to the repositioning or discontinuation of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia (brand portfolio impairment charges) and the favorable impact of lower impairment charges related to the SodaStream business (other impairment charges), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction. Operating profit improvement also reflects the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 54-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily sweeteners, packaging and potatoes, a 16-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, higher advertising and marketing expenses and the organic volume decline. AMESANet revenue declined 5%, primarily reflecting a 21-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, driven primarily by the weakening of the Egyptian pound, and a net organic volume decline, partially offset by effective net pricing.Convenient foods unit volume declined 3.5%, primarily reflecting a high-single-digit decline in South Africa, partially offset by high-single-digit growth in the Middle East and low-single-digit growth in Pakistan. Additionally, India experienced a low-single-digit decline.Beverage unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India and low-single-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Pakistan and a low-single-digit decline in Nigeria.Operating profit grew 21%, primarily reflecting a 24-percentage-point favorable impact of impairment and other charges associated with our decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands and an investment in the prior year (brand portfolio impairment charges), a 4-percentage-point favorable impact of impairment charges primarily related to certain juice brands from the Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) acquisition in the prior year (other impairment charges), the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 70-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, sweeteners and grains, largely driven by transaction-related foreign exchange, certain operating cost increases and a 21-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, primarily due to weakening of the Egyptian pound. 45Table of ContentsAPACNet revenue grew slightly, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by a 4-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and a net organic volume decline.Convenient foods unit volume declined 2%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in Thailand and a low-single-digit decline in Australia, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in China.Beverage unit volume grew 2.5%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in China, high-single-digit growth in Thailand and low-single-digit growth in Vietnam, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the Philippines.Operating profit grew 33%, primarily reflecting a 23-percentage-point favorable impact of lower impairment charges related to the Be & Cheery brand (other impairment charges), the effective net pricing and productivity savings.

We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.46Table of ContentsThe following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below:Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth ratesThese measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment and other charges comprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, product recall-related impact, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers, tax benefit related to the IRS audit and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.Organic revenue growthWe define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53rd reporting week, including in our 2022 financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information.Free cash flowWe define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.47Table of ContentsSee “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparabilityWe define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.Items Affecting ComparabilityOur reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years: 48Table of Contents(a)Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. (a)Does not sum due to rounding.Mark-to-Market Net ImpactWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.49Table of ContentsRestructuring and Impairment Charges2019 Multi-Year Productivity PlanThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through December 30, 2023, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.9 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.4 billion. In our 2024 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $500 million each. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures through 2025, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs.See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.Acquisition and Divestiture-Related ChargesAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Gain Associated with the Juice TransactionWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Impairment and Other ChargesWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.Russia-Ukraine Conflict ChargesIn connection with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Brand Portfolio Impairment ChargesWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022.See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.50Table of ContentsOther Impairment ChargesWe recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in TBG.See Notes 1, 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Product Recall-Related ImpactWe recognized product returns, inventory write-offs and customer and consumer-related costs in our QFNA division associated with a voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Pension and Retiree Medical-Related ImpactPension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.See Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Tax Benefit Related to the IRS AuditWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Tax Expense Related to the TCJ ActTax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Charge Related to Cash Tender OffersAs a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.51Table of ContentsOur sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results.As of December 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of December 30, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $579 million of this liability in 2024. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.Supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements.Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.The table below summarizes our cash activity: Operating ActivitiesIn 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $13.4 billion, compared to $10.8 billion in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable operating profit performance coupled with favorable working capital comparisons.Investing ActivitiesIn 2023, net cash used for investing activities was $5.5 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $5.3 billion.In 2022, net cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $5.0 billion and our investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius) convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute Celsius energy drinks of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion.See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our agreement with 52Table of Contentsand investment in Celsius; and see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures.We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.Financing ActivitiesIn 2023, net cash used for financing activities was $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $6.7 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion, as well as payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $5.5 billion and net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $2.3 billion.In 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $2.5 billion and debt redemptions/cash tender offers of $1.7 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.4 billion.See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.We annually review our capital structure with our Board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2024, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.42 per share from $5.06 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2024. We expect to return a total of approximately $8.2 billion to shareholders in 2024, comprising dividends of approximately $7.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion.Free Cash FlowThe table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.”We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of 53Table of Contentsdebt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.Changes in Line Items in Our Consolidated Financial Statements Changes in line items in our consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Consolidated Review,” “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.”Changes in line items in our consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Changes in line items in our consolidated balance sheet are discussed below:Total AssetsAs of December 30, 2023, total assets were $100.5 billion, compared to $92.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets is primarily driven by the following line items:Total LiabilitiesAs of December 30, 2023, total liabilities were $81.9 billion, compared to $74.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items:(a)In billions.Total EquitySee our consolidated statement of equity and Notes 9 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements.Return on Invested CapitalROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on ROIC, see “Non-GAAP Measures.”(a)Includes a quarterly average of short-term and long-term debt obligations.54Table of Contents(b)Includes a quarterly average of common stock, capital in excess of par value, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive loss and repurchased common stock.The table below reconciles ROIC as calculated above to net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability.OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESAn appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.Our critical accounting policies and estimates are:•revenue recognition;•goodwill and other intangible assets;•income tax expense and accruals; and•pension and retiree medical plans.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. Our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and 55Table of Contentsfreshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsWe sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow 56Table of Contentsperformance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” In 2023, we recorded $0.6 billion ($0.4 billion after-tax or $0.32 per share) of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand and $0.3 billion ($0.3 billion after-tax or $0.22 per share) of goodwill impairment charges related to the SodaStream reporting unit in Europe. As a result, the carrying value of the SodaStream reporting unit as of December 30, 2023 is equal to its fair value and the SodaStream reporting unit is at a heightened risk of future goodwill impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. For example, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity growth rate used to estimate the fair value of the 57Table of ContentsSodaStream reporting unit would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. We will continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream reporting unit, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Income Tax Expense and AccrualsOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.In 2023, our annual tax rate was 19.8% compared to 16.1% in 2022. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information.See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical PlansOur pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.58Table of ContentsSee “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.Our AssumptionsThe determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;•the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; and•the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: (a)2022 rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.We expect our pension and retiree medical expense to remain consistent in 2024 primarily reflecting the change in demographic experience, offset by the recognition of gains on plan assets and impact of discretionary plan contributions.59Table of ContentsSensitivity of AssumptionsA decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 100-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2024 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:FundingWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.We made a discretionary contribution of $150 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2024.Our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.60Table of ContentsConsolidated Statement of IncomePepsiCo, Inc. and SubsidiariesFiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions except per share amounts)See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.61Table of ContentsConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive IncomePepsiCo, Inc. and SubsidiariesFiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions)See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.62Table of ContentsConsolidated Statement of Cash FlowsPepsiCo, Inc. and SubsidiariesFiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions)(Continued on following page)63Table of ContentsConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows (continued)PepsiCo, Inc. and SubsidiariesFiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions)See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.64Table of ContentsConsolidated Balance SheetPepsiCo, Inc. and SubsidiariesDecember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in millions except per share amounts)See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.65Table of ContentsConsolidated Statement of EquityPepsiCo, Inc. and SubsidiariesFiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021(in millions except per share amounts) (a) Cash dividends declared per common share were $4.9450, $4.5250 and $4.2475 for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.66Table of ContentsNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our DivisionsBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule: Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.67Table of ContentsOur DivisionsWe are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:1)Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;2)Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;3)PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;4)Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;6)Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and7)Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa.The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:•share-based compensation expense;•pension and retiree medical expense; and•derivatives.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseOur divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.68Table of ContentsPension and Retiree Medical ExpensePension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. DerivativesWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.Net Revenue and Operating Profit/(Loss)Net revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:(a)See below for impairment and other charges taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment and other impairment. (b)In 2023, operating profit included a pre-tax charge of $136 million ($104 million after-tax or $0.07 per share) in cost of sales for product returns, inventory write-offs and customer and consumer-related costs associated with the Quaker Recall.(c)In 2022, we recorded a gain of $3,029 million and $292 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction. The total after-tax amount was $2,888 million or $2.08 per share. See Note 13 for further information.69Table of ContentsDisaggregation of Net RevenueOur primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following table reflects the percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: (a)Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is 35%, 37% and 40% of our consolidated net revenue in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.Impairment and Other ChargesWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.A summary of pre-tax charges taken in 2022 in our Europe division as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is as follows:(a)See Note 4 for further information. For information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.In 2023, a pre-tax credit of $7 million ($7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share) was recorded in our Europe division, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, representing adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. In addition, a tax benefit of $68 million ($0.05 per share) was recorded in our Europe division related to the impairment of certain consolidated investments.70Table of ContentsA summary of pre-tax charges taken in 2022 as a result of our decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment is as follows:(a)See Note 4 for further information. For information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.In 2023, a pre-tax credit of $13 million ($13 million after-tax or $0.01 per share) was recorded in our AMESA division, with $9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $4 million in cost of sales. In addition, a pre-tax charge of $2 million ($1 million after-tax with a nominal amount per share) was recorded in our LatAm division in selling, general and administrative expenses. Both of these amounts represent adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.71Table of ContentsA summary of pre-tax impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in TBG is as follows:(a)See Note 4 for further information. For information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.COVID-19 ChargesOperating profit includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic related to incremental employee compensation costs, such as certain leave benefits and labor costs, employee protection costs, allowances for expected credit losses and upfront payments to customers and their related adjustments for changes in estimates as conditions improve. These pre-tax charges were not significant in 2023. In 2022 and 2021, these pre-tax charges by division were as follows:(a)Income amount primarily relates to adjustments for changes in estimates of allowances for expected credit losses and upfront payments to customers, due to improved projected default rates and lower at-risk balances.72Table of ContentsCorporate Unallocated Expenses Corporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, tax-related contingent consideration, certain acquisition and divestiture-related charges, certain gains and losses on equity investments, as well as certain other items.Other Division Information Total assets and capital spending of each division are as follows:(a)Corporate assets consist principally of certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, derivative instruments, property, plant and equipment, pension plan assets and tax assets. In 2023, the change in assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization of each division are as follows:73Table of ContentsNet revenue and long-lived assets by country are as follows:(a)Long-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets, investments in noncontrolled affiliates and other investments included in other assets. See Notes 2 and 15 for further information on property, plant and equipment. See Notes 2 and 4 for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets. See Notes 9 and 15 for further information on other assets. These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used.Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. Our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2023, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. 74Table of ContentsTotal Marketplace SpendingWe offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $228 million as of December 30, 2023 and $242 million as of December 31, 2022 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.7 billion in 2023, $5.2 billion in 2022 and $5.1 billion in 2021, including advertising expenses of $3.8 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in both 2022 and 2021. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:•media and personal service prepayments;•promotional materials in inventory; and•production costs of future media advertising.Deferred advertising costs of $67 million and $40 million as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.Distribution CostsDistribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $15.4 billion in 2023, $15.0 billion in 2022 and $13.7 billion in 2021.75Table of ContentsSoftware CostsWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $159 million in 2023, $123 million in 2022 and $135 million in 2021. Net capitalized software and development costs were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.Research and DevelopmentWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $804 million, $771 million and $752 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent 76Table of Contentswith our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 4 for further information. Other Significant Accounting PoliciesOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:•Basis of Presentation – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.•Income Taxes – Note 5.•Share-Based Compensation – Note 6.•Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7.•Financial Instruments – Note 9.•Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.•Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. For inventories valued under the LIFO method, the differences between the LIFO and FIFO methods of valuing inventories are not material.•Property, Plant and Equipment – Note 15. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. •Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements AdoptedIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in fiscal year 2024 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the rollforward guidance when effective, in our 2024 annual reporting. See Note 14 for disclosures currently required under this guidance.77Table of ContentsNot Yet AdoptedIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance transparency of income tax disclosures. On an annual basis, the new guidance requires a public entity to disclose: (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) additional information for reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) by the applicable statutory income tax rate, (3) income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with foreign taxes disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid, (4) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign, and (5) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated between federal (national), state and foreign. The guidance is effective for fiscal year 2025 annual reporting, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2025 annual reporting, on a prospective basis.In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance disclosure of expenses of a public entity’s reportable segments. The new guidance requires a public entity to disclose: (1) on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (2) on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items (the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss), including a description of its composition, (3) on an annual and interim basis, information about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets previously required to be disclosed only on an annual basis, and (4) the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources. The new guidance also clarifies that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss, one or more of those measures may be reported and requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal year 2024 annual reporting, and in the first quarter of 2025 for interim period reporting, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2024 annual reporting.Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges2019 Multi-Year Productivity PlanWe publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. 78Table of ContentsThe total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:(a)Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements. Other costs primarily include costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including consulting and other professional fees, as well as contract termination costs.79Table of ContentsA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan is as follows:(a)Excludes cash expenditures of $1 million in 2023, $1 million in 2022 and $2 million in 2021, reported in the cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical plan contributions.The majority of the restructuring accrual at December 30, 2023 is expected to be paid by the end of 2024.Other Productivity InitiativesThere were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan.We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. For information on additional impairment charges, see Notes 1, 4 and 9 for impairment and other charges taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges.Note 4 — Intangible AssetsA summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows:80Table of ContentsAmortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset’s estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 30, 2023 and using average 2023 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsAs discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third quarter. The annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2023, based on best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, did not result in any material impairment charges.In the fourth quarter of 2023, macroeconomic conditions, including higher interest rates, inflationary costs, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and recent business performance indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $0.6 billion ($0.5 billion after-tax or $0.35 per share) for brands and $0.3 billion ($0.3 billion after-tax or $0.22 per share) for goodwill, both in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand and reporting unit in our Europe division, in the year ended December 30, 2023. See Note 1 for further information.In the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $241 million ($193 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. In the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflected the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax 81Table of Contentsimpairment charges of $1.2 billion ($958 million after-tax or $0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. In the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflected the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax or $0.94 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 25, 2021.As of December 30, 2023, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights, as well as further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream reporting unit goodwill, if future sales and their contributions to operating profit do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions) or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.82Table of ContentsThe change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows:(a)Impairment in 2022 is related to a baked fruit convenient food brand.(b)Acquisitions in 2022 primarily reflect our agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States. Translation and other in 2023 primarily reflects adjustments to previously recorded amounts related to our agreement with Celsius. See Note 9 for further information.(c)Impairment in 2022 is related to the sale of certain non-strategic brands. See Note 1 for further information.(d)Translation and other in 2023 primarily reflects the depreciation of the Russian ruble, partially offset by appreciation of the euro and British pound. (e)Impairment in 2022 is related to the SodaStream brand, the decrease in fair value as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the discontinuation or repositioning of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia. Impairments in 2023 are related to SodaStream goodwill and brand.83Table of Contents(f)Impairment is related to brands from the Pioneer Foods acquisition. (g)Impairment in 2022 and 2023 is related to the Be & Cheery brand.Note 5 — Income TaxesThe components of income before income taxes are as follows:The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:A reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to our annual tax rate is as follows:Tax Cuts and Jobs ActIn 2022, we recorded $86 million ($0.06 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of correlating adjustments related to a partial audit settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2019. In 2021, we recorded $190 million ($0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 IRS audit. As of December 30, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021. We currently expect to pay approximately $579 million of this liability in 2024.84Table of ContentsThe TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.Other Tax MattersIn 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million ($0.08 per share) in 2021.In 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $233 million ($0.17 per share) in 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.85Table of ContentsDeferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:A summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: 86Table of ContentsReservesA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.As of December 30, 2023, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $2.1 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $390 million as of December 30, 2023, of which $102 million of tax expense was recognized in 2023. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $292 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $4 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2022.A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:Carryforwards and AllowancesOperating loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling $34.7 billion as of December 30, 2023 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses and income tax credits from prior periods to reduce future taxable income or income tax liabilities. These operating losses and income tax credits will expire as follows: $0.4 billion in 2024, $29.8 87Table of Contentsbillion between 2025 and 2041 and $4.5 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.Undistributed International Earnings As of December 30, 2023, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.Note 6 — Share-Based CompensationOur share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs. As of December 30, 2023, 28 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:As of December 30, 2023, there was $441 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.Method of Accounting and Our AssumptionsThe fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no 88Table of Contentslonger required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. Stock OptionsA stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 30, 2023 is as follows:(a)In thousands.89Table of ContentsRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock UnitsEach RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 30, 2023 is as follows:(a)In thousands. Outstanding awards are disclosed at target.(b)The outstanding PSUs for which the vesting period has not ended as of December 30, 2023, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero, 0.7 million and 1.3 million, respectively.(c)Represents the number of outstanding awards expected to vest, including estimated performance adjustments on all outstanding PSUs as of December 30, 2023.Long-Term CashCertain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo’s total shareholder return relative to a specific set of peer companies and achievement of a specified performance target over a three-year performance period. Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 90Table of ContentsA summary of our long-term cash activity for the year ended December 30, 2023 is as follows:(a)In thousands, disclosed at target. (b)In thousands, based on the most recent valuation as of December 30, 2023.(c)The outstanding awards for which the vesting period has not ended as of December 30, 2023, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels based on the achievement of its market conditions were zero, $52 million and $104 million, respectively.Other Share-Based Compensation DataThe following is a summary of other share-based compensation data:(a)In thousands.As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were approximately 330,000 and 307,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above.91Table of ContentsNote 7 — Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings PlansEffective December 31, 2022, we merged two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), mostly inactive participants, and PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A), mostly active participants, with Plan I remaining. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The merger was made to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses of the merged plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this merger.In 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further information.In 2021, we adopted a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.In 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from Plan A to Plan I, effective January 1, 2022. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H) (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 10 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 26 years).The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective December 31, 2025 is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.92Table of ContentsSelected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows: The net loss arising in the current year is primarily attributable to the impact of lower discount rates, partially offset by an increase in the actual return on plan assets.93Table of ContentsThe amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. •Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.•Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. •Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. •Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:(a)In 2022, U.S. includes a settlement charge of $318 million ($246 million after-tax or $0.18 per share) related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost. 94Table of ContentsThe following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for our pension and retiree medical plans:(a)2022 U.S. rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.The following table provides selected information about plans with accumulated benefit obligation and total projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:Of the total projected pension benefit obligation as of December 30, 2023, approximately $678 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:(a)Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $1 million for each of the years from 2024 through 2028 and approximately $2 million in total for 2029 through 2033.These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.95Table of ContentsFundingContributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows:(a)Includes $250 million contribution in 2023, $150 million contribution in 2022 and $500 million contribution in 2021 to fund our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans.We made a discretionary contribution of $150 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2024. In addition, in 2024, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $99 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and contributions of approximately $51 million for retiree medical benefits.We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.For 2024 and 2023, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.4%. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a 96Table of Contentsmethod that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2023 and 2022 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows:(a)Includes $183 million and $196 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries.(b)Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common and preferred stock investments are based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund that represents 13% and 10% of total U.S. plan assets for 2023 and 2022, respectively. (c)These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represents 31% and 32% of total U.S. plan assets for 2023 and 2022, respectively. (d)Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.(e)Includes Level 1 assets of $3 million for 2023 and Level 2 assets of $346 million and $157 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.(f)The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.(g)Based on the published price of the fund.97Table of ContentsRetiree Medical Cost Trend RatesThe assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows:Annually, we review external data and our historical experience to estimate assumed health care cost trend rates that impact our retiree medical plan obligation and expense, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. Savings PlanCertain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.Certain U.S. employees, who are either not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan or whose benefit is capped, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on either years of service or age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.In 2023, 2022 and 2021, our total Company contributions were $356 million, $283 million and $246 million, respectively.Note 8 — Debt ObligationsThe following table summarizes our debt obligations:(a)Amounts are shown net of unamortized net discounts of $225 million and $227 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.(b)The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. 98Table of ContentsAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our international debt of $279 million and $304 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.In 2023, we issued the following senior notes:(a)Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.In 2023, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2028. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $4.2 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $3.8 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 27, 2022.Also in 2023, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 24, 2024. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $4.2 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $3.8 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 27, 2022.Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 30, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.In 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of $102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022.In 2022, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due May 2022, we paid $800 million to redeem all $800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10% senior notes due July 2022 and we paid $154 million to redeem all $133 million outstanding 99Table of Contentsprincipal amount of our subsidiary, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc.’s 7.00% senior notes due March 2029 and 5.50% notes due May 2035.In 2021, we completed cash tender offers to redeem $4.1 billion principal amount of certain notes, with maturity dates ranging from May 2035 to March 2060 and interest rates ranging from 3.375% to 5.500%, for $4.8 billion in cash. As a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million ($677 million after-tax or $0.49 per share) to net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. Also in 2021, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70% senior notes due 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million.Note 9 — Financial InstrumentsDerivatives and HedgingWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:•commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and•interest rates.In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; there were no such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 30, 2023. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.Credit RiskWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.100Table of ContentsCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 30, 2023 was $144 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 30, 2023.Commodity PricesWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.7 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Foreign ExchangeWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.8 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $3.0 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.Interest RatesWe centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of our cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than 101Table of Contentstwelve years. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of December 30, 2023, approximately 9% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 1%, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 31, 2022.Debt SecuritiesHeld-to-MaturityInvestments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of commercial paper. As of December 30, 2023, we had $309 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, we had no investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 30, 2023, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.Available-for-SaleInvestments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security.In 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States (see Note 4 for further information) and invested $550 million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after six years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years. Shares underlying the transaction were priced at $75 per share, and the preferred shares are entitled to a 5% annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. Given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of this investment was classified as Level 2, based primarily on the transaction price. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investment in the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 30, 2023, we transferred $558 million from Level 2 to Level 3 as unobservable inputs to the fair value became more significant and subsequently recorded an unrealized gain of $612 million in other comprehensive income and a decrease in the investment of $14 million due to cash dividends received. There were no impairment charges related to our investment in the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.102Table of ContentsTBG InvestmentIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). See Note 13 for further information.In 2023, we recorded our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings, which includes an impairment of TBG’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $321 million ($243 million after-tax or $0.18 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our PBNA division. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG, which we categorized as Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in the fair value hierarchy.Recurring Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are categorized as follows:(a)Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.103Table of Contents(b)Includes Level 2 assets of $178 million and Level 3 assets of $1,156 million as of December 30, 2023, and Level 2 assets of $660 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 30, 2023, $1,334 million was classified as other assets. As of December 31, 2022, $3 million, $104 million and $553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively. The fair values of these Level 2 investments approximate the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. The fair value of our Level 3 investment in Celsius is estimated using probability-weighted discounted future cash flows based on a Monte Carlo simulation using significant unobservable inputs such as an 80% probability that a certain market-based condition will be met and an average estimated discount rate of 8.1% based on Celsius’ estimated synthetic credit rating. An increase in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or a decrease in the discount rate would result in a higher fair value measurement, while a decrease in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower fair value measurement.(c)Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d)Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (e)Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections.(f)Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (g)Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (h)Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $41 billion and $35 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.Losses/(gains) on our cash flow and net investment hedges are categorized as follows:(a)Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in net revenue and cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. See Note 11 for further information.104Table of ContentsBased on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net losses of $112 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity into net income during the next 12 months.Losses/(gains) recognized in the income statement related to our non-designated hedges are categorized as follows:Note 10 — Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common ShareThe computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows:(a)Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions). (b)The dilutive effect of these securities is calculated using the treasury stock method.The weighted-average amount of antidilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share was 3 million for the year ended December 30, 2023 and immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. 105Table of ContentsNote 11 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Attributable to PepsiCoThe changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to PepsiCo are as follows:(a)The changes primarily represent fair value increases in available-for-sale debt securities, including our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock in 2023. See Note 9 for further information. (b)Pension and retiree medical amounts are net of taxes of $1,514 million as of December 26, 2020, $1,283 million as of December 25, 2021, $1,184 million as of December 31, 2022 and $1,282 million as of December 30, 2023.(c)Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Turkish lira, Swiss franc and Mexican peso.(d)Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Egyptian pound and British pound sterling.(e)Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Russian ruble and South African rand, partially offset by the appreciation of the Mexican peso.106Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the income statement:Note 12 — LeasesLesseeWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).107Table of ContentsComponents of lease cost are as follows:(a)Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $570 million, $517 million, and $505 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. (b)Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c)Not recorded on our balance sheet.In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized gains of $52 million, $175 million and $42 million, respectively, on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under five years.Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows:Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows:Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:Maturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows:Finance leases were not material as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.LessorWe have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.108Table of ContentsNote 13 — Acquisitions and DivestituresJuice TransactionIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see detailed income statement activity below), including $520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39% ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement.A summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:(a)Includes $186 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in TBG.(b)Includes $16 million curtailment gain, partially offset by $6 million special termination benefits.(c)Does not sum due to rounding.In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to TBG to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, TBG is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup.The Juice Transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no amounts classified as held for sale. In the year ended December 30, 2023, we recognized impairment charges related to our TBG investment. See Notes 1 and 9 for further information. 109Table of ContentsAcquisition and Divestiture-Related ChargesAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.A summary of our acquisition and divestiture-related charges is as follows:(a)Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.(b)Income amount primarily relates to the acceleration payment made in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the contingent consideration arrangement associated with our acquisition of Rockstar, which is partially offset by divestiture-related charges associated with the Juice Transaction.(c)Primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.(d)The amount in 2021 includes a tax benefit related to contributions to socioeconomic programs in South Africa.Note 14 — Supply Chain Financing ArrangementsAs part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of both December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $1.7 billion of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements.110Table of ContentsNote 15 — Supplemental Financial InformationBalance Sheet(a)Increase primarily reflects strong revenue performance across much of our portfolio in 2023.(b)2021 includes reductions in allowance for expected credit losses related to COVID-19 pandemic recorded in 2020.(c)Includes accounts written off. (d)Includes adjustments related primarily to currency translation and other adjustments.(e)Change is driven by increase in capital spending, partially offset by depreciation. (f)See Note 7 for further information.(g)See Note 12 for further information.(h)Increase in 2023 primarily reflects unrealized pre-tax gains on our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock. See Note 9 for further information.(i)Increase reflects higher capital expenditures and commodity costs in 2023.(j)Increase primarily reflects change in income tax provision. See Note 5 for further information. 111Table of ContentsStatement of Cash Flows (a)2022 excludes the premiums paid in accordance with the debt transactions. 2021 excludes the charge related to cash tender offers. See Note 8 for further information.(b)In each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, includes tax payments of $309 million related to the TCJ Act. Supplemental Non-Cash ActivityThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported within the balance sheet to the same items as reported in the cash flow statement: (a)Primarily relates to collateral posted against certain of our derivative positions.112Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and Board of DirectorsPepsiCo, Inc.:Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.113Table of ContentsDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Sales incentive accrualsAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, 114Table of Contentsbased on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and SodaStream goodwill As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. The carrying value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 30, 2023 was $13.7 billion, which represents 13.7% of total assets, and includes certain PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights, which had a carrying value of $8.7 billion as of December 30, 2023. The carrying value of goodwill as of December 30, 2023 was $17.7 billion, which represents 17.6% of total assets, and includes goodwill related to the SodaStream reporting unit in Europe.We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and SodaStream goodwill in Europe as a critical audit matter. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets required significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. Significant auditor judgment was necessary to assess the subjective and uncertain impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of revenue, operating profit and cash flows.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, expected long-term growth rates, and selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion related to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared forecasted revenue and profitability levels in the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies. Unrecognized tax benefitsAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 30, 2023, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts 115Table of Contentsthese reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements./s/ KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.New York, New YorkFebruary 8, 2024116Table of ContentsGLOSSARYAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.Bottler Case Sales (BCS): measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2023.Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our fourth quarter of 2023, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During 2023, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with our 2019 multi-year 119Table of Contentsproductivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan.Item 9B.

We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. You should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for the provisions that are important to you.GeneralOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds cents (1-2/3 cents) per share. As of February 2, 2024, there were 1,374,429,271 shares of common stock outstanding which were held of record by 94,999 shareholders.Voting Rights. Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the applicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.Dividend Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by PepsiCo’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.Rights Upon Liquidation. Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of PepsiCo, in all remaining assets available for distribution to shareholders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’s liabilities.Preemptive Rights. Holders of our common stock do not have the right to subscribe for, purchase or receive new or additional common stock or other securities.Transfer Agent and RegistrarComputershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.2Stock Exchange ListingThe Nasdaq Global Select Market is the principal market for our common stock, where it is listed under the symbol “PEP,” and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.Certain Provisions of PepsiCo’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws; Director Indemnification AgreementsAdvance Notice of Proposals and Nominations. Our By-Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written notice to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders. Notice for an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, such notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing “proxy access” must meet separate deadlines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder’s notice. These provisions may prevent shareholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or from nominating candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.Proxy Access. Our By-Laws contain “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareholder (or a group of up to 20 shareholders aggregating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable annual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of our By-Laws.3Special Meetings. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the Board or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more shareholders holding shares of record representing at least 20% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at the request of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the date of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary. The By-Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder’s request for a special meeting.Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees. Our By-Laws provide that unless the Board determines otherwise, we shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an action, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the fact that such person, such person’s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, officers or employees, or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer or employee of another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. Pursuant to our By-Laws this indemnification may, at the Board’s discretion, also include advancement of expenses prior to the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each director against any and all liabilities and assessments (including attorneys’ fees and other costs, expenses and obligations) arising out of or related to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or other, including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval), and any interest, assessments, excise taxes or other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any of the foregoing, incurred by the independent director and arising out of his status as a director or 4member of a committee of our Board, or by reason of anything done or not done by the director in such capacities. After receipt of an appropriate request by an independent director, we will also advance all expenses, costs and other obligations (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to such matters. We will not be liable for payment of any liability or expense incurred by an independent director on account of acts which, at the time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in conflict with our best interests.Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of North Carolina LawThe North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the affirmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’s voting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly, more than 20% and is still an “affiliate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any merger, consolidation or conversion of a corporation with or into any other entity, or (ii) any sale or lease of all or any substantial part of the corporation’s assets to any other entity, or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for securities of the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other entity.The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act contains provisions that allowed a corporation to “opt out” of the applicability of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act’s voting provisions within specified time periods that generally have expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.This statute could discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial position in our equity securities or seeking to obtain control of us. It also might limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our 5shares of common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.DESCRIPTION OF NOTESWe have previously filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177307), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 13, 2011 and covers the issuance of the 2026 notes, a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-197640), which was filed with the SEC on July 25, 2014 and covers the issuance of the July 2028 notes, a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-216082), which was filed with the SEC on February 15, 2017 and covers the issuance of the 2027 notes, 2031 notes and 2039 notes and a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-234767), which was filed with the SEC on November 18, 2019 and covers the issuance of the sterling notes, 2024 notes, May 2028 notes, 2032 notes, 2033 notes and 2050 notes.The notes were issued under an indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the “indenture”).

The principal and interest payments in respect of the sterling notes, including payments made upon any redemption of any series of the sterling notes, are payable in sterling. If sterling is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if sterling is no longer being used for settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the sterling notes will be made in U.S. dollars until sterling is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in sterling will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for sterling, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be responsible for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.Currency of Payment of Euro Notes. The principal and interest payments in respect of the euro notes, including payments made upon any redemption of any series of the euro notes, are payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the euro notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for euro, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the euro notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the euro notes or 10the indenture governing the euro notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.Definition of Business Day. The term “business day” with respect to the sterling notes means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. If any interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date is not a business day, then the related payment for such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay.The term “business day” with respect to the euro notes means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. If any interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date is not a business day, then the related payment for such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay.Interest Payments. Each series of notes will bear interest at the per annum rate stated in its title. Interest on the notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue for the period to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Markets Association.11Optional RedemptionSterling Notes2029 Notes.

provided that:• we will be the surviving corporation or, if not, that the successor will be a corporation that is organized and validly existing under the laws of any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia and will expressly assume by a supplemental indenture our obligations under the indenture and the notes;• immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no event of default, and no default or other event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, will have happened and be continuing; and• we will have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer complies with the indenture.In the event of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, any such successor will succeed to and be substituted for us as obligor on the notes with the same effect as if it had been named in the indenture as obligor, and we will be released from all obligations under the indenture and under the notes.Definitions“Consolidated net tangible assets” means the total amount of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries’ assets minus:• all applicable depreciation, amortization and other valuation reserves;30• all current liabilities of ours and our restricted subsidiaries (excluding any intercompany liabilities); and• all goodwill, trade names, trademarks, patents, unamortized debt discount and expenses and other like intangibles, all as set forth on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ latest consolidated balance sheets prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.“Debt” means any indebtedness for borrowed money.“Principal property” means any single manufacturing or processing plant, office building or warehouse owned or leased by us or any of our restricted subsidiaries other than a plant, warehouse, office building or portion thereof which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, is not of material importance to the business conducted by us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as an entirety.“Restricted subsidiary” means, at any time, any subsidiary which at the time is not an unrestricted subsidiary of ours.“Subsidiary” means any entity, at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock of which shall at the time be owned, directly or indirectly, by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries, or both.“Unrestricted subsidiary” means any subsidiary of ours (not at the time designated as our restricted subsidiary) (1) the major part of whose business consists of finance, banking, credit, leasing, insurance, financial services or other similar operations, or any combination thereof, (2) substantially all the assets of which consist of the capital stock of one or more subsidiaries engaged in the operations referred to in the preceding clause (1), or (3) designated as an unrestricted subsidiary by our Board of Directors.Events of DefaultAn “Event of Default” under the notes of a given series means:31(1) default in paying interest on the notes when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or more;(2) default in paying principal, or premium, if any, on the notes when due;(3) default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes due, and such default continues for 30 days or more;(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of PepsiCo in the indenture (other than defaults specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and the default or breach continues for a period of 90 days or more after we receive written notice from the trustee or we and the trustee receive notice from the holders of at least 51% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series;(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, administration or similar proceedings with respect to PepsiCo have occurred; or(6) any other Events of Default set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo) under the indenture occurs with respect to the notes of any series and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series may by written notice require us to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes), together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any.If an Event of Default under the indenture specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes) will automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder.32After a declaration of acceleration, the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes of any series may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default, except for nonpayment of the principal and interest on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement, have been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in paying principal, premium or interest on any outstanding note, or in respect of a covenant or a provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of all holders of the notes of that series.Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series may seek to institute a proceeding only after they have notified the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In addition, within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a holder of a note for the enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any premium on or after the due dates for such payment.During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct of that person’s own affairs. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee is not under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity. Subject to certain provisions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.33The trustee will, within 90 days after any default occurs, give notice of the default to the holders of the notes of that series, unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when due, the trustee can withhold giving notice to the holders if it determines in good faith that the withholding of notice is in the interest of the holders.Modification and WaiverThe indenture may be amended or modified without the consent of any holder of notes in order to:• evidence a succession to the trustee;• cure ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies;• provide for the assumption of our obligations in the case of a merger or consolidation or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets;• make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the notes of a series;• add guarantors with respect to the notes of any series;• secure the notes of a series;• establish the form or forms of notes of any series;• maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; or• make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any holder.Other amendments and modifications of the indenture or the notes issued may be made with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series affected by the amendment or modification. However, no 34modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note affected:• reduce the principal amount, interest or premium payable, or extend the fixed maturity, of the notes;• alter or waive the redemption provisions of the notes;• change the currency in which principal, any premium or interest is paid;• reduce the percentage in principal amount outstanding of notes of any series which must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver or consent to take any action;• impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on the notes;• waive a payment default with respect to the notes or any guarantor;• reduce the interest rate or extend the time for payment of interest on the notes;• adversely affect the ranking of the notes of any series; or• release any guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in compliance with the terms of the indenture.Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant DefeasanceWe may terminate our obligations under the indenture, when:• either:• all the notes of any series issued that have been authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or• all the notes of any series issued that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and payable, will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year and we 35have made arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by such trustee in our name and at our expense, and in each case, we have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee sufficient funds to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the series of notes to pay principal, interest and any premium; and• we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums then due and payable under the indenture; and• we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been complied with.We may elect to have our obligations under the indenture discharged with respect to the outstanding notes of any series (“legal defeasance”). Legal defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding notes of such series under the indenture, except for:• the rights of holders of the notes to receive principal, interest and any premium when due;• our obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of transfer of the notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment for security payments held in trust;• the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and• the defeasance provisions of the indenture.In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certain covenants in the indenture (“covenant defeasance”). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the notes of any series. In the event covenant defeasance occurs, certain events, not including non-payment, 36bankruptcy and insolvency events, described under “Events of Default” above will no longer constitute an event of default for that series.In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to outstanding notes of any series:• we must irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to the benefit of the holders of the notes of a series:• money in an amount;• U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations in the case of notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars or a specified currency) that will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount; or• a combination of money and U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations, as applicable),in each case sufficient, in the written opinion (with respect to U.S. or equivalent government obligations or a combination of money and U.S. or equivalent government obligations, as applicable) of a nationally recognized firm of independent registered public accountants, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the trustee to pay and discharge, all of the principal (including mandatory sinking fund payments), interest and any premium at the due date or maturity;• in the case of legal defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that, under then applicable federal income tax law, the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge to be effected and will 37be subject to the same federal income tax as would be the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge did not occur;• in the case of covenant defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and covenant defeasance to be effected and will be subject to the same federal income tax as would be the case if the deposit and covenant defeasance did not occur;• no event of default or default with respect to the outstanding notes of that series has occurred and is continuing at the time of such deposit after giving effect to the deposit or, in the case of legal defeasance, no default relating to bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on or before the 91st day after the date of such deposit, it being understood that this condition is not deemed satisfied until after the 91st day;• the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, assuming all notes of a series were in default within the meaning of such Act;• the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which we are a party;• the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless the trust is registered under such Act or exempt from registration; and• we must have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent with respect to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.38Book-Entry, Delivery and SettlementWe have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any time.The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear, either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers through customers’ securities accounts in Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear. The address of Clearstream is 42 Avenue JF Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.The distribution of the notes was cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the notes will take place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro with respect to the euro notes, except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.39Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to be issued, held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the secondary market.The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the investor’s interest in the notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants. We also do not supervise these systems in any way.Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers. You should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.Except as provided otherwise, owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes.Certificated Notes. Subject to certain conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the euro notes if:40(1) the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;(2) we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all the notes of any series represented by the global note; or(3) default entitling the holders of the applicable notes of any series to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and is continuing.Any note of any series that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes of such series issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the common depositary (or its nominee).Same-day Payment. Payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) and transfers with respect to notes of any series in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the applicable notes of such series, provided that all payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required.41 EX-10.6 9 pepsico202310-kxexhibit106.htm PEPSICO INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM DocumentExhibit 10.6THE PEPSICO INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT PLANDEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM (PIRP-DB)As Amended and RestatedEffective as of January 1, 2023TABLE OF CONTENTSiii ARTICLE I - HISTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION The Plan came into operation on and took effect from September 1, 1980, and was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules”, and was later amended and restated in its entirety, effective September 2, 1982. The Plan was further amended and restated in its entirety, effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took effect. The Plan was further amended effective January 1, 2005, so that no person subject to taxation in the United States of America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject to U.S. taxation. Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form a single governing legal document, as set forth herein. The terms of the Plan set forth in this amended and restated governing legal document are known as the “DB Program” (also known as “PIRP-DB”). This amended and restated governing legal document shall apply to Members who are in Membership from and after January 1, 2010, as well as any others who claim rights from and after January 1, 2010 that are derived from current or former Membership, including former Members and the Dependants and Eligible Spouses of Members and former Members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the amendment and restatement of this Plan, the supersession of the prior documents by this Plan, and the prior existence of separate Plan A and Plan B Rules shall not at any time result in any duplication of benefits (nor shall duplication of benefits result from any other factor or circumstance related to this Plan or any prior version of this Plan). Effective January 1, 2011, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them participate in their home country retirement plans and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC Program are set forth in a separate governing legal document. Together, the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DB Program was previously amended and restated, effective January 1, 2016. The DB Program was again amended and restated, effective January 1, 2019. The DB Program’s most recent prior restatement was effective January 1, 2021 and provided for freezing the DB Program effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2025. As a result, effective on and after January 1, 2026, all accruals under the DB Program, as well as all Pensionable Service, Salary and other compensation that are recognized under the Plan, are treated as ending no later than at the end of the day on December 31, 2025, and where the DB Program requires that Salary or other compensation be averaged over a period of service, service after December 31, 2025 is not taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with the DB Program’s usual rules that would apply in the absence of the DB Program freeze, a Member shall continue to earn Service (for purposes of determining whether the Member has a vested right to a Pension) and entitlement Service (for purposes of applying more favorable early retirement factors under the DB Program) and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold relevant to qualify for such early retirement factors while still an Employee, even after December 31, 2025. In 1addition, the portion of the formula that requires projecting and prorating a Member’s benefit, the denominator of the applicable fraction is projected to include service after December 31, 2025 as if the DB Program were not going to freeze while the numerator of the fraction is calculated taking into account the December 31, 2025 freeze, and then the resulting fraction is frozen as of December 31, 2025; a Member shall continue to earn Service and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold while still an Employee that would result in the inapplicability of the projecting and prorating formula even after December 31, 2025. The current restatement of the Plan is effective as of January 1, 2023 (the “Restatement Date”). Effective as of the Restatement Date, the Plan’s definition of Eligible Employee is revised to narrow the group that may initially qualify or continue to qualify as Eligible Employees. At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’s individual employer. With respect to his employer, the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor. The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States. 2ARTICLE II - DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION2.01 Definitions.Where the following words and phrases appear in this governing legal document for the DB Program, they shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context:(a) "Active Member" means a who is currently eligible to accrue Pensionable Service under the DB Program; accordingly, it refers to a Member who has been admitted or re-admitted to Membership pursuant to Article III, but who has not retired on Pension, withdrawn from or otherwise ceased to be (or to be deemed to be) in Service as an Eligible Employee, or for any other reason ceased to be eligible to accrue Pensionable Service for the purpose of the DB Program.(b) “Actuarial Equivalent” means Actuarial Equivalent as defined in paragraph (2) (Standard Actuarial Factors) of Section 2.1 of Part B of the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A, subject to paragraphs (3) (Applicability of the Standard Actuarial Factors) and (5) (Additional Defined Terms and Special Rules) thereof.(c) "Actuary" means the individual actuary or firm of actuaries selected by the Vice President to provide actuarial services in connection with the administration of the DB Program.

(w) "PepsiCo Salaried Plan" means the program of pension benefits set forth in Part B of the PSERP Component of both the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (“PERP-A”) and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (“PERP-I”), as it may be amended from time to time, and as it was set forth prior to January 1, 2017 in predecessor plans to PERP-A and PERP-I.(x) "Salary" means in relation to a Member his calendar year base pay, plus overtime pay, commission payments and amounts paid pursuant to the incentive compensation plans (annual bonus plans) of an Employer, but shall exclude – (1) Any pay that would ordinarily qualify as Salary as described above to the extent it is earned by the Member – (i) while working for the PepsiCo Organization or any Employer in the United States, (ii) while participating in the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, and/or (iii) while a U.S. Person, and (2) All other amounts taxable as remuneration for personal services, including amounts received or deemed received under any other pension or welfare plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo Organization or any Employer, premium bonuses, sign-on bonus or other one-time payments, income from stock option exercises and any special allowances (whether given in respect of residence, cost of living, education, transfer or otherwise).If a Member has Salary in accordance with the prior sentence and then ceases to be employed by an Employer (but the Member remains employed by a member of the PepsiCo Organization), compensation while employed by the member of the PepsiCo Organization that otherwise would qualify as Salary hereunder shall be considered Salary for purposes of the DB Program. In the event a Member’s Salary is either (i) paid in currency other than United States dollars or (ii) paid in United States dollars but not tied to the United States salary ranges established by the Corporation, as updated from time to time, such currency shall be converted to United States dollars according to procedures established by the Global Mobility Team, or if no so such procedures exist as of the time in question, as reasonably determined by the Vice President. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this definition, the Vice President may exercise his discretion to determine a Member's Salary based on an alternative definition that is different than that set forth above. (y) "Service" means in relation to a Third Country National (or other employee deemed an Eligible Employee by the Vice President) only the period during which such Third Country National (or such other employee) was continuously in employment (including all permissible periods of authorized leave of absence) with any Approved 6Employer. A permissible period of authorized leave of absence is a period of absence of not more than 12 months, unless a longer period is individually authorized in writing by the Vice President. A break in service of less than 12 months shall not be considered to have broken the continuity of a Member's Service. Other breaks in service (including a break in service of at least 12 months and a break in service before an individual has become a Member) shall break the continuity of an individual’s Service, and employment before the break in service will only be counted as Service if it would otherwise qualify under this subsection and the Vice President approves its being counted (which approval may provide for such pre-break employment being counted as vesting Service, entitlement Service, or both). Vesting Service means Service that is taken into account solely in determining vesting, and entitlement Service means Service that is taken into account solely in determining entitlement for Early Retirement, Normal Retirement and Late Retirement. For an individual who transfers from employment with an Employer as an ineligible Employee to the status of an Eligible Employee of an Employer, his pre-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as Service only with the approval of the Vice President (which approval may provide for such pre-transfer employment being counted as vesting Service, entitlement Service, or both). Except as otherwise provided by the Vice President, Service shall not include an individual’s periods of employment with any company or undertaking prior to it becoming an Employer or a member of the PepsiCo Organization. No determination of an individual’s Service shall result in any duplication, and all of the DB Program’s provisions shall at all times be interpreted consistently with the terms of this subsection.

The records described in the preceding sentence are intended to be maintained outside the United States of America. (bb) "U.S. Person" means: (1) a citizen of the United States of America; (2) a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States of America at any time during the calendar year, or who has applied for such permanent residence (within the meaning of United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)(1)(A)); or (3) any other person who is a resident alien of the United States of America under United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)(1)(A) because, for example, the person satisfies the substantial presence test under United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)(3) or makes an election to be treated as a United States resident under United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)(4). In addition, a person shall be considered a U.S. Person for purposes of Section 9.14 in any year for which the person is 7required by the United States Internal Revenue Code to file an individual income tax return, unless the Vice President determines that it is clear that the person has no U.S. source earned income from a member of the PepsiCo Organization for such year.(cc) "Vice President" means the Vice President, Global Benefits & Wellness of PepsiCo, Inc. but if such position is vacant or eliminated it shall be the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of the duties, if no one is fulfilling a majority), as such duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the position elimination.2.02 Construction.(a) Gender and Number: In this document for the DB Program where the context does not otherwise determine, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender and words importing the singular number shall include the plural number and vice versa. (b) Determining Periods of Years: For the purposes of the DB Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of 366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29th February) shall be deemed to constitute a year, but not so that in the calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a proportionate amount (i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be included in the calculation. Where the this document makes reference to months or parts of a year, or to any other period of time except a day, week or year the Vice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year.(c) Compounds of the Word “Here”: The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire DB Program, not to any particular provision or section. (d) Examples: Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).(e) Subdivisions of This Document: This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses.

In addition, every person who was a Member but not an Active Member immediately prior to January 1, 2021 shall continue as a Member of the DB Program from and after the Restatement Date, to the extent such Membership is and remains consistent with the provisions of the DB Program, as amended and in effect on and after January 1, 2021 (and thereafter, as amended and in effect on and after the Restatement Date). (b) Every person who is not a Member and who the Vice President determines is an Eligible Employee shall, following the approval of his Membership by the Vice President, be admitted to Membership, effective as of the Entry Date coinciding with or immediately following the date on which his Service commences or he becomes an Eligible Employee (as determined by the Vice President), whichever is later. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to or continue in Membership without the approval of the Vice President.9ARTICLE IV - REQUIREMENTS FOR BENEFITS4.01 Normal Retirement Pension. A Member shall be entitled to a Normal Retirement Pension if his employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization terminates on his Normal Retirement Age. The Member’s Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the day the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization. The Member’s Pension shall be paid in the normal form of payment applicable to the Member under Section 5.02 unless the Member elects an optional form of payment under Section 5.03. The Member’s Pension shall be calculated in accordance with Table A. 4.02 Early Retirement Pension. A Member shall be entitled to an Early Retirement Pension if his employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization terminates on or after age 55 but before his Normal Retirement Age, and after he has completed 10 or more years of Service. The Member’s Annuity Starting Date ordinarily shall be his Normal Retirement Date. The Member may, however, by filing a written election with the Vice President, direct that his Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of any month after the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization but before the Member's Normal Retirement Date. The amount of such Pension shall be computed in accordance with Table A as if the Member retired at his Normal Retirement Date, but on the basis of the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary (as defined in Table A) and Pensionable Service as of his employment termination date; provided, however, that, in the case of a Member electing to receive his Pension prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced by 4/12 of 1 percent for each month by which the day on which the Pension commences precedes the date on which the Member would have attained age 62.4.03 Special Early Retirement Pension. A Member may be entitled to receive a Special Early Retirement Pension if his employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization terminates on or after age 50 but before age 55 and after completion of not less than 10 years of Service and only if such Special Early Retirement Pension payments have been authorized by the Vice President. The Annuity Starting Date of such Special Early Retirement Pension shall be the first day of the month after the Vice President authorizes such Special Early Retirement Pension. The amount of such Pension shall be computed in accordance with Table A, as if the Member retired at his Normal Retirement Date, but on the basis of the Member's Highest Average Monthly Salary (as defined in Table A) and Pensionable Service as of his employment termination date; provided, however, that the amount of such Member's Pension so determined shall be reduced by 4/12 of 1 percent for each month by which the day on which the Pension commences precedes the date on which the Member would have attained age 62.4.04 Deferred Vested Pension. (a) This Section 4.04 applies to a Member who terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization before becoming eligible for a Normal Retirement Pension, Early Retirement Pension or Special Early Retirement Pension.10 (b) A Member described in (a) above who has met one of the requirement to be vested in Sections 4.06 and 4.07 shall be entitled to receive a Pension (hereinafter referred to as a “Deferred Vested Pension”). The amount of such Deferred Vested Pension shall be determined in accordance with Table A; provided, however, that in the case of a Member who remains in the employment of the PepsiCo Organization or any Employer after ceasing to be an Active Member, the amount of such Member’s Deferred Vested Pension shall be determined in accordance with Table A by reference to (i) the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary at the date the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization (but only to the extent permitted under Sections 9.13 and 9.14), and (ii) the Member’s Pensionable Service as of his termination of employment date. (c) A Member’s Deferred Vested Pension shall commence at the later of (i) the Member’s termination of employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization, or (ii) the Member’s Normal Retirement Date. However, a Member may elect, by filing a written election with the Vice President to have his Deferred Vested Pension commence as of the first day of any month after the date he attains age 55 (or the date of his termination of employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization, if later). In the case of a Member electing to receive his Deferred Vested Pension prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced in accordance with the reduction factors applicable to early commencement of a “Vested Pension” under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, not the percentage factors which apply to an Early and Special Early Retirement Pension as described in Sections 4.02 and 4.03.(d) If Member becomes entitled to a Deferred Vested Pension under subsection (a) above and once again becomes an Eligible Employee, he shall be re-admitted to Active Membership in accordance with the provisions of Article III. His Service and Pensionable Service from his earlier period as an Active Member shall be aggregated with his subsequent period of Service and Pensionable Service for purposes of calculating his Pension upon his later retirement or other termination of employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization, but only if his Pension with respect to his earlier period of Pensionable Service was not previously cashed out under Section 5.05.4.05 Late Retirement Pension.A Member who continues employment with the PepsiCo Organization or any Employer after his Normal Retirement Age shall be entitled to a Late Retirement Pension. The Member’s Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the day the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization. The Member shall be credited with his Salary and Pensionable Service after his Normal Retirement Date, unless otherwise prospectively determined by the Vice President. 4.06 Vesting.Subject to Sections 9.14 and 9.08 and to Table A (I)(c), a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his Pension upon completing 5 years of Service, or if earlier, upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the Employer or PepsiCo Organization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made by the Vice President in accordance with such standards that the Vice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question. The accrual of a Pension benefit pursuant to this Plan shall not in any way exempt the Pension benefit from the full application of the Company’s clawback and other forfeiture and 11recovery policies (“Clawback Policies”), as they are in effect from time to time. Accordingly, a Member’s Pension benefit shall be subject to forfeiture (and if paid out, to recovery) to the extent determined to be appropriate by the Vice President to give full effect to these Clawback Policies. Section 9.08 shall not be construed to reduce or impair the forfeiture and recovery rights provided by this Section 4.06.4.07 Special Vesting for Approved Transfers and Status Changes.(a) Automatic Special Vesting for Approved Transfers. Notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have an Approved Transfer during a Plan Year, the Active Member shall automatically have special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member’s Approved Transfer, or (b) the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved Transfer. (b) Special Vesting for Status Changes. Also notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the Vice President apply special vesting to him as of the last business day before the Active Member’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and effective under the DB Program, the Active Member’s request and the Vice President’s approval of the request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies. Subject to the next sentence, the effect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 4.06 if the Member vested under that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 4.07, rights under this Section 4.07 are subject to the overriding requirement that benefits and other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 4.07 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with this requirement.4.08 Accruals After Benefit Commencement.This section applies to a Member who earns Service and Pensionable Service for a period that is after his Annuity Starting Date under the preceding Sections of this Article IV (other than an Annuity Starting Date related to a cashout distribution under Section 5.05). Any prior benefits that have been suspended, and any additional benefits accrued by Member after his prior benefit commencement, shall be paid at his subsequent Annuity Starting Date. The suspension or continuation of a Member’s prior benefits, any adjustments to the Member’s benefits that are payable upon his subsequent Annuity Starting Date, and the election of a time and form of payment for benefits payable at the subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall be subject to rules established by the Vice President for this purpose. Such rules shall be based upon the PepsiCo Salaried Plan’s rules for benefits accrued after the benefit commencement date of a participant in that plan, unless the Vice President determines that a modification of those rules is appropriate. 12ARTICLE V - DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS5.01 Distribution Options. (a) Section 5.02 sets forth the normal forms of payment for married and unmarried Members. For purposes of Section 5.02, a Member is considered married if he is married on his Annuity Starting Date. (b) Section 5.03 sets forth the optional forms of payment that may be available to married and unmarried Members who elect not to receive benefits in the normal form. For purposes of Section 5.03, a Member will also be considered married if he is married on the date he elects an optional form of payment.(c) A distribution is only available under this Article V to the extent a Member has met the requirements for benefits under Article IV. 5.02 Normal Forms of Payment.(a) Single Life Annuity for Unmarried Members: An unmarried Member shall be paid his Pension in the form of a Single Life Annuity unless he elects otherwise in accordance with Section 5.03. The Single Life Annuity provides monthly payments beginning at the Member's Annuity Starting Date and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the Member's death. (b) 50 Percent Survivor Annuity for Married Members: A married Member shall be paid his Pension in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity, as described herein, unless he elects otherwise in accordance with Section 5.03.

For Annuity Starting Dates on or After January 1, 2019, the amount of the Member’s Pension, determined in accordance with Table A, shall be reduced to its Actuarial Equivalent to reflect the survivor benefit payable. For earlier Annuity Starting Dates, subject to Section 5.03(f), the amount of the Member’s Pension, determined in accordance with Table A, shall be reduced by 10 percent. In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension under Section IV of the Plan, as in effect prior to January 1, 1990, the Member’s Pension accrued as of such date shall not be subject to this reduction to the extent provided under the Plan’s terms as of such date. 5.03 Optional Forms of Payment.(a) Optional Forms Available to Married Members: A married Member who elects not to receive benefits in the normal form may receive his Pension in the form of the Single Life Annuity described in Section 5.02(a) above or the 75 Percent Survivor Annuity described in (b)(2) below, regardless of whether he is eligible for the optional forms of payment described in (b), (c) and (d) below.(b) Survivor Options: A married or unmarried Member who elects not to receive benefits in the normal form may elect to receive payment of his Pension in accordance with one of the survivor options listed below.

The Member also may designate, prior to commencement, a Dependant to receive the survivor portion of his elected survivor option on such form as may be required by the Vice President; provided, however, that (1) the approval of the Vice President shall be necessary if the Member designates a Dependant other than the Member’s Eligible Spouse; and (2) if a married Member elects an option described in this subsection (b) and names a Dependant other than his Eligible Spouse, he must submit written evidence of the Eligible Spouse’s consent to such option and designation of a Dependant. A Member may not change his form of benefit or Dependant after his Pension has commenced. (1) 100 Percent Survivor Option: The Member shall receive a reduced Pension payable for his life and payments in the same reduced amount shall continue after the Member's death to his Dependant for life. The amount of the Member's reduced Pension shall be the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined in Section 2.01) of the Member’s Single Life Annuity benefit determined in accordance with Table A (or for Annuity Starting Dates before January 1, 2019, the Table A amount reduced by 20 percent, subject to subsection (f) below).

The amount of the Mem’er's reduced Pension shall be the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined in Section 2.01) of the Member’s Single Life Annuity benefit determined in accordance with Table A (or for Annuity Starting Dates before January 1, 2019, the Table A amount reduced by 10 percent, subject to subsection (f) below). In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension under the Plan as in effect prior to January 1, 1990, his Pension shall not be subject to this reduction.(4) Ten-Year Certain and Life Option: Subject to Section 5.04, a Member may elect to receive a reduced Pension payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If the Member dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the remainder of the 120-month period to the Member's primary Dependant (if the primary Dependant has predeceased the Member, to the Member's contingent Dependant; and if there is no contingent Dependant, to the Member’s estate). If post-death payments commence to a Member’s primary or contingent Dependant and such Dependant dies before all remaining payments due have been made, then the remaining payments shall be paid to such Dependant’s estate. Effective as of January 1, 2010, the Member’s Dependant or estate (as applicable) may elect by following the procedures set forth by the Vice President for this purpose, instead to receive a 14single lump sum payment that is the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments due to such Dependant or estate (but computed without reduction for mortality), determined as of the date on which the lump sum payment is processed by the Vice President. The amount of the Member's reduced Pension shall be the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined in Section 2.01) of the Member's Single Life Annuity benefit determined in accordance with Table A (or for Annuity Starting Dates before January 1, 2019, the Table A amount reduced by 5 percent, subject to subsection (f) below). (c) Lump Sum Payment: Subject to Section 5.04, a Member who elects not to receive benefits in the normal form may elect to receive payment of his Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment. The amount of the single lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Single Life Annuity, determined in accordance with Table A, utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors applicable to lump sum distributions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan (disregarding transition factors), calculated as of the date payments would have commenced under the normal form of benefit or other optional benefit. The lump sum payment shall be made in one taxable year of the Member and shall be paid as soon as practicable after the date specified by the Member in his written election. Effective for lump sum payments due to be paid on or after January 1, 2010, interest will be added to late lump sum payments in accordance with the administrative practices of the PepsiCo Salaried Plan. No interest shall be payable on such sum during any such deferred period specified by the Member. (d) Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit: Subject to Section 5.04, a married or unmarried Member who elects not to receive his Pension in the normal form may elect to receive payment of his Pension in the form of a combination lump sum/monthly benefit option. If elected, the Member shall receive a portion of his benefit in the form of a lump sum payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in Sections 5.02 and 5.03. The benefit shall be divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by the Member on a form provided for this purpose. To be effective, the two percentages designated by the Member must add to 100 percent(1) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount determined under Section 5.03(c) by (B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.(2) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Member, determined in accordance with Sections 5.03(a) or (b), by (B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit. (e) Death Prior to Pension Becoming Payable: If a Member who is entitled to an immediate Pension under Article IV elects an optional form of payment under this Section 5.03, if such election meets all requirements to be effective (other than the Member’s survival, but including the time for making the election and any necessary Eligible Spouse’s consent), and thereafter the Member dies after leaving employment but before such Pension becomes payable, then on the first day of the month next following his death such optional form of payment shall be deemed to be in effect. Such deemed effectiveness may only apply once and only to the initial election made by a Member (except as permitted by a decision of the Vice President that is made prior to the Member’s submission of a subsequent purported election). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the option under Section 5.03(b), if the Member’s specified 15Dependant has died or shall die before the date on which the first installment of the Member’s Pension was prospectively payable in accordance with the optional form of payment elected by the Member, the Member’s election of such optional form shall not be given effect.(f) Reduction for Certain Younger Dependants: Notwithstanding the reduction factors specified in Sections 5.02(b) and 5.03, in the case of Annuity Starting Dates before January 1, 2019, a Member electing a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall have his Pension reduced in accordance with this subsection (f) in the event the Dependant under such survivor option is more than 10 years younger than the Member.(1) Not More than 20 Years Younger: In the event the Dependant is more than 10 years younger than the Member, but not more than 20 years younger, the percentage reduction that otherwise would apply shall be increased by 5 percentage points.(2) More than 20 Years Younger: In the event the Dependant is more than 20 years younger than the Member, the 5 percentage point increase in the reduction provided in (1) above shall be further increased by an additional 0.2 percent for each full year over 20.5.04 Applicability of Certain Options. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article V, the availability of certain distribution options shall be restricted in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04. (a) Pre-1990 Distributions: The form of payment described in Section 5.03(d) above shall not be available unless the Member's Annuity Starting Date is after 1989.(b) Deferred Vested Pensions: Deferred Vested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall be eligible for payment only under the Single Life Annuity, the 50 Percent Survivor Option or the 75 Percent Survivor Option, except as provided in the next sentence. Effective as of January 1, 2015, Deferred Vested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall also be eligible for the Lump Sum Payment option, but only to the limited extent that such option is available on an on-going basis with respect to deferred vested pensions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan (except that unlike participants in the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, participants in this Plan with a benefit under the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan shall not be excluded from the Lump Sum Payment option). (c) Simplified Actuarial Factors: In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension prior to January 1, 1990, the actuarial equivalencies described in the preceding provisions of this Article V shall be adjusted as provided by the Vice President from time to time to reflect the value of any subsidized survivor benefit to which the Member is entitled under the last sentence of Section 5.02(b) (regarding the availability on favorable terms of the survivor benefit described in Section 5.02(b)). 5.05 Cashout of Certain Benefits. (a) Cashout of Small Benefits. Where the total Pension payable to any person under the DB Program is, in the opinion of the Vice President, of an amount that is relatively trivial (when considered by itself or in relation to the potential administrative burden of continuing to keep track of such Pension under the DB Program), he may commute the whole of such Pension to a lump sum payable following (i) the relevant 16Member’s termination of employment from both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization, or (ii) a Member’s transfer within the PepsiCo Organization that results in the Member ceasing to actively accrue all benefits under the DB Program, on a date determined in the discretion of the Vice President, without the consent of the Member.(b) Discretionary Cashout After Benefit Commencement. Effective January 1, 2019, the Vice President shall have the discretion to make a lump-sum payment to any Member whose benefit payments have commenced (in a form other than a lump-sum), if the present value of the Member’s remaining stream of payments is less than on equal to $75,000 on the payment date. The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Member’s remaining stream of payments, determined utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors specified in Section 5.03(c) calculated as of the a payment date determined in the discretion of the Vice President.5.06 Designation of Dependant.A Member who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a Dependant who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the effective date of his election. If the Member is married at the time he designates a Dependant, any designation under this section of a Dependant who is not the Member’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant does not require consent by the Member’s Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant, and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Vice President, shall be made in writing on forms provided by the Vice President, and shall not be effective unless and until filed with the Vice President. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 5.03(b)(4), the following shall apply: (i) the Member shall be entitled to name both a primary Dependant and a contingent Dependant, and (ii) if no Dependant is properly designated, then a Member’s election of such option will not be given effect.17ARTICLE VI - DEATH BENEFITSThe surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable, of a Member who dies shall be entitled to certain survivor benefits if the requirements of this Article VI are satisfied. Except as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03, the amount of any such benefit shall be determined in accordance with Section II of Table A.6.01 Active and Retirement-Eligible Members. In the event of the death of an Active Member, a Member in Service after his Normal Retirement Date who had at his death completed at least 5 years of Service, or a Member entitled to an Early Retirement Pension under Section 4.02 or Special Early Retirement Pension under Section 4.03, if such Member is survived by an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic Partner and is not entitled at the time of death to the protection provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension payable to the Member’s surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner (as applicable), calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section II of Table A. 6.02 Vested Members. In the event of the death of a Member who is not described in Section 6.01 above, who is vested under Section 4.06 or Section 4.07 and who has not yet commenced or received the Member’s Pension, if such Member is survived by an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic Partner and is not entitled at the time of death to the protections provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be payable a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension (as applicable), which shall be calculated based on the Member’s Salary and Pensionable Service as of the earlier of the Member’s death or termination of employment. The benefit shall be calculated as if the Member lived until the earliest date the Member’s vested benefit could have started, after having elected to start his benefit at that time in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity, and died that same day. Coverage for this Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension shall be paid for with a reduction to the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Member. The reduction charged to the Member’s benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology, and based on the same factors, provided for under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, as in effect from time to time. The Member may only waive this Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Coverage (as applicable) with the approval of the Vice President. 6.03 Form and Time of Payment of Death Benefits.(a) Form of Payment: Any Pension payable pursuant to this Article VI shall be payable for the surviving Eligible Spouse’s or surviving Domestic Partner’s life only; however, in the case of a Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Domestic Partner where the Member was eligible for a Normal, Early or Special Early Retirement Pension at death, the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner may elect to receive the Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment in lieu of the annuity payment.(b) Time of Payment: Subject to Section 6.04, any Pension payable to the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner under this Article VI shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the Member’s death, or if later, the date on which the Member would have attained age 55. In the event a Pension 18payable to a Member’s Eligible Spouse commences before the Member would have reached Normal Retirement Age, the benefit will be reduced as set forth in Section 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04, as applicable based on the Pension to which the Member was entitled, to reflect early commencement.6.04 Disposition of Death Benefits. Any benefit expressed to be subject to disposition in accordance with the provision of this Article VI shall be held by the Vice President with power to pay or apply the same to or for the benefit of such one or more of the Member’s Dependants, as the Vice President shall think fit and if more than one in such shares as they shall likewise think fit. Notwithstanding any other provision of the DC Program, the Vice President may direct that such benefit shall commence or be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Member’s date of death.19ARTICLE VII - ADMINISTRATION7.01 Authority to Administer Plan. (a) Administration by the Vice President: The Plan shall be administered by the Vice President, who shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the Vice President hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by the Vice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned. (b) Authority to Delegate: The Vice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the Vice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such action by the Vice President’s delegate or other designated person. 7.02 Facility of Payment.Whenever, in the opinion of the Vice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Vice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Vice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.7.03 Claims Procedure. The Vice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Vice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the Vice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). All decisions and determinations made by the Vice President shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Vice President may consider the intent of the Corporation with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent.If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit or any other right related to the Plan (a “claim”), by or on behalf of a Member, putative Member, Dependant or putative Dependant (a “claimant”), is wholly or partially denied, the Vice President, or a party designated by the Vice President, will provide such claimant the claims procedure described in this section. The Vice President has the discretionary authority to modify the claims procedure described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the basic steps described in this Section. In the event of a claim by a claimant, the Vice 20President or the designated party shall provide the claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Vice President, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and(4) A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).If the Vice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Vice President will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision. Upon review, the Vice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Vice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the Vice President’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Vice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section and in accordance with Section 7.07. 7.04 Limitations on Actions.Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Member, Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively, a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Vice President on which payments shall commence; or (iii) when he has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no effect on this two-year time frame. 217.05 Restriction of Venue.Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New York, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies, located nearest the Corporation’s headquarters.7.06 Effect of Specific References.Specific references in the Plan to the Vice President’s discretion shall create no inference that the Vice President’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.7.07 Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court.Before filing any Claim (as defined below in this Section), including a suit or other action, in a court or in another tribunal, a Claimant (as defined below in this Section) must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’s rights under the claims procedure in Section 7.03.(a) Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.06 is intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a Claim unless the purported Claimant took sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the purported Claimant was submitting a Claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) this Plan or applicable law requires the documents to be provided in response to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Vice President, (C) the Vice President fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor took sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the requestor was asserting a legal right to the documents. Accordingly, without limitation, a purported Claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Member shall not be deemed to have taken sufficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the Vice President that he is claiming to have been entitled to be a Member.(b) The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.06 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes (as defined below in this Section) that are not Claims (including those that a court or other tribunal might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Vice President may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential, and (iv) even if the Vice President has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Vice President, upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.03 that apply to claims for benefits).(c) The Vice President may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.22(e) For purposes of this Section 7.06, the following definitions apply.(1) A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter.(2) A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –(A) The interpretation of the Plan;(B) The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;(C) The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;(D) Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into effect;(E) The administration of the Plan;(F) Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;(G) A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;(H) An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any legal duty; or(I) Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Vice President, or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way.It is the Vice President’s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times consistently with any requirements of applicable law. Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan, the Plan imposes a contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with respect to any Claim (as defined above) in order to allow for the efficient and uniform resolution of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially substantial and unnecessary litigation expenses that exhaustion could obviate.(3) A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Eligible Employee, former Eligible Employee, Member, former Member, Dependant (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.23ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION8.01 Continuation of the Plan. While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely, it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance. The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall adversely affect the amount of benefit to which a Member or his Dependant is entitled under the Plan on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the Member becomes entitled to an amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the Corporation. Specific forms of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence.8.02 Amendment. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to the Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive effect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.8.03 Termination. The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers. If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in effect for the benefit of the employees of the remaining Employers.24ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS9.01 Unfunded Plan.The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when due out of the Employer’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer. 9.02 Costs of the Plan.Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, charges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and management of the Plan shall be the costs, charges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost or expense is incurred.9.03 Temporary Absence of Member.If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, discharge, retirement or quitting (e.g., sickness, accident, layoff, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is absent, unless the Vice President determines otherwise. If the Member’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time member of the armed forces of any country or of any organization engaged in national service of any such country, he shall not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur.9.04 Taxes, Etc.In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the Vice President to be owing in respect of any benefit payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty.9.05 Nonguarantee of Employment.Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its employees, with or without cause. 9.06 No Right to Benefits.No person, whether or not being a Member, shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member’s termination of employment by an Employer, the resulting cessation of his Active Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any member of the PepsiCo Organization with respect to such termination.259.07 Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments. All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand charged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the Vice President that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member. The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member’s benefits and be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Organization whose receipt shall be a valid discharge for the same.Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable. Accordingly, any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or Dependant status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –(1) A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a person, trust fund or entity).(2) The right to offset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however, reliance on this right is in the discretion of the Vice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the Plan’s rights under paragraph (1) above.(3) The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may correspond to such party’s present or future residence.Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the Vice President that are in furtherance of the Plan’s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way, including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.9.08 Termination for Cause; Prohibited Misconduct.(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Vice President determines that a Member has been terminated for cause or engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of the date his or her employment with the PepsiCo Organization terminates, the Member shall forfeit his Pension (whether paid previously, being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her Pension shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and any previously paid Pension payments shall be recovered. Section 4.06 shall not be construed to reduce or impair the 26forfeiture rights provided by this Section 9.08, but the Vice President shall have the authority to reduce the forfeitures that would apply under this Section to the extent necessary to avoid an inappropriate duplication (determined in the Vice President’s sole discretion) of the forfeitures applicable under Section 4.06. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this, and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly, by a Member shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the Member’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Organization.(2) The Member, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member’s recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Organization employee to leave the PepsiCo Organization’s employment or to accept any position with any other entity.(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo Organization other than as necessary in his or her position with the PepsiCo Organization. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his or her positions with the PepsiCo Organization, which might be of any value to a competitor of the PepsiCo Organization, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the PepsiCo Organization or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo Organization’s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies. (4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Organization’s best interests, including violating the Corporation’s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the PepsiCo Organization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.27Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or in any other confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject as a result of the Participant’s employment with the Company, nothing shall prohibit the Member, without notice to the Company, communicating with government agencies, providing information to government agencies, participating in government agency investigations, filing a complaint with government agencies, or testifying in government agency proceedings concerning any possible legal violations or from receiving any monetary award for information provided to a government agency.. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further, notwithstanding any confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Organization is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – in-home and commercial beverage systems, carbon dioxide gas cylinders, carbon dioxide gas refills, consumables, and ready-to-drink beverages, including without limitation, carbonated soft drinks, tea, water, juices, juice drinks, juice products sports drinks, coffee drinks, alcoholic beverages, and energy drinks; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, fruit and vegetable snacks, dips and spreads, sweet snacks, meat snacks, granola, nutrition and cereal bars, and cookies; hot cereals and ready-to-eat cereals; pancake mixes and pancake syrup; grain-based food products; pasta products; sports performance nutrition products, including without limitation, energy, protein, carbohydrate, nutrition and meal replacement chews, bars, powders, gels, drinks or drink mixes; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo Organization during the Member’s employment with the PepsiCo Organization.9.09 Notices.Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be sufficiently given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the Vice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be sufficient if such notice is delivered to the Member’s last known address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method (e.g., electronically) that the Vice President determines is reasonably available to the Member.289.10 Plan Documentation. Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the governing legal document for the DB Program.9.11 Currency of Payment.Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency," as approved by the Vice President. For both annuity and lump sum payments, the amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the Vice President from time to time.9.12 Governing Law.The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York. 9.13 Exemption from ERISA.The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, both Active Membership in the Plan and the opportunity to increase Highest Average Monthly Earnings after ceasing to be an Active Member, in accordance with Section 4.04(b), shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States. 9.14 Exemption from Section 409A.In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section 409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, effective for any period to which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively, a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person. Accordingly, no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined, following the close of such year, that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the Vice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year. In other cases, the Member’s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that benefits and any other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the Vice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement.29ARTICLE X - SIGNATURE The PepsiCo International Retirement Plan, DB Program document, as amended and restated, is hereby adopted as of this 11th day of December, 2023, to be effective as of January 1, 2023 or as otherwise stated herein. PEPSICO, INC. By: /s/ Becky Schmitt Becky SchmittExecutive Vice President andChief Human Resources OfficerDate: December 11, 2023Law Department ApprovalBy: /s/ Jeffrey Arnold Jeffrey Arnold Legal Director, Employee Benefits CounselDate: December 11, 2023 30TABLE A - CALCULATION OF PENSIONS This section sets forth the formulas for calculating the Pension payable to a Member under Article IV or the Death Benefit payable to a Member’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable, under Article VI, but subject in all cases to the freeze of the Plan described in Article I. Any benefits accrued under the DB Program by a Member while a part-time employee, following such Member’s designation by the Vice President as an Eligible Employee pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of Eligible Employee in Section 2.01, shall be prorated as determined by the Vice President to reflect the approximate ratio of the Member’s level of services during such part-time status to the level required for full-time status at the Member’s work location.(I) Member’s Pension(a) The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date for Members who became members of the Plan before January 1, 1976 shall be the larger of the Pension calculated under this paragraph (a) or under paragraph (b) below. The Pension under this paragraph (a) shall be the greater of (1) or (2) below: (1) 1.5 percent of the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of years of Pensionable Service; or (2) 3 percent of the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary, multiplied by the number of years of his Pensionable Service but not exceeding 15 years.(b) The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date (i) for Members who became members of the Plan on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) for persons (other than those in (i)) who became Members on or after September 1, 1980, and (iii) for persons (other than in (i) or (ii)) who became Members after November 12, 1998, shall be the Pension calculated under this paragraph (b). The pension calculated under this paragraph (b) shall be the aggregate of:(1) For up to the first 10 years of Pensionable Service, the product of (i) 3 percent of the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary, multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service, but not exceeding 10 such years; plus(2) For any years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10, the product of (i) 1 percent of the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary, multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10.(c) At the discretion of the Vice President, the Pension calculated as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be reduced by some or all of the following:(1) All state pension and social security benefits receivable by the Member attributable to Service other than those derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member;(2) The annuity equivalent of a like portion of all capital sum benefits receivable by the Member on or by reason of his retirement either from a state source or from the Employer in consequence of a requirement of local legislation, including, but not limited to, termination indemnities;31(3) Any benefits payable to the Member (or in respect of him) from other retirement benefit plans (or cash allowance received in lieu of Employer contributions to a retirement benefit plan) of the Employers in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other retirement benefit plans of the Employers;(4) Any other payment made by the Employer at the time of termination of the Member that arises from any severance agreement made between the Employer and Member, for whatsoever reason; (5) The value (as determined in accordance with methodology approved by the Vice President) of any benefits paid to the Member prior to his retirement from any plan in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other retirement benefit plans of the Employers;(6) Any deductions, reductions or forfeiture of a Member's benefits resulting from a Member's misdemeanor, misconduct or discharge for cause pursuant to Section 9.08 hereof. No such deduction shall be made in respect of any such benefits as are derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member. The value of all such deductions shall be subject to adjustment to reflect the form and timing of payment. All deductions set out in this paragraph (c) shall be calculated as of the Member’s termination date and in accordance with methodology approved by the Vice President from time to time.(d) If the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Member is reduced under paragraph (c) above, an alternative calculation of the Pension for such Member shall apply unless the Vice President determines that the alternative calculation would be unnecessary or impractical or would not serve the purposes of the DB Program. Under this alternative calculation, only the Member’s Pensionable Service under this DB Program, which does not include any employment that is taken into account in determining benefits under paragraph (c)(1) - (5), shall be considered, and the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) - (5) shall be disregarded (however, the reduction under paragraph (c)(6) shall be taken into account). If this alternative calculation applies, the Pension payable under this alternative calculation shall be compared to the Pension payable under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, and whichever provides the greater Pension amount will be payable to or on behalf of the Member, subject to the remaining provisions of this paragraph (d). The alternative calculation set forth in this paragraph (d) is intended to provide a calculation methodology that replicates the effect of the “extended wearaway” calculation methodology, as it is in effect from time to time under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this paragraph (d), any benefit increase provided as a result of this paragraph (d) will be limited so that in the judgment of the Vice President it is not in excess of what should be available given the intent described in the preceding sentence. (e) For purposes of this Table A, "Highest Average Monthly Salary" means one twelfth of the yearly average of the Member’s Salary over any 5 consecutive calendar years of Service in which such Salary was highest (or over such lesser period as the Member has been in Service). For purposes of determining a Member's Highest Average Monthly Salary, the following shall apply: (1) A calendar year with no Salary shall be disregarded, and the calendar years preceding and following such calendar year (or years) shall be considered consecutive.32(2) If in a calendar year there is an unpaid authorised leave of absence, or other absence from paid service, that results in less than a complete year of Salary, such calendar year shall be disregarded and the next preceding or succeeding year or years shall be taken into account if it results in a higher average.(f) In determining the amount of a Deferred Vested Pension for the purposes of Section 4.04, the Pension shall be equal to the greatest of the amounts determined under subsection (1), (2) or (3) below:(1) The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Age (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and Highest Average Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member’s actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Age. (2) The aggregate of:(i) The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and Highest Average Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member’s actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date; and (ii) The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and the Highest Average Monthly Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member’s actual years of Pensionable Service after September 30, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date. (3) The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and the Highest Average Monthly Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member’s actual years of Pensionable Service and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date. For Members who became Members of the Plan before January 1, 1976, the Deferred Vested Pension shall be the larger of 1½ percent of the Member’s Highest Average Monthly Salary multiplied by the Member’s number of years of Pensionable Service at termination or the amount determined by the Vice President based on actuarial information provided to the Vice President.All deductions set out in (c) above that are applicable to a Member entitled to a Deferred Vested Pension shall be calculated as of the time such Member ceases to be in Service and in accordance with methodology approved by the Vice President.33(II) Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies after the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension to which the Member would have been entitled if he had retired on the day preceding his death (having elected a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)) and reduced in accordance with Section 4.02 if the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 62. If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies before the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension to which the Member would have been entitled if he had attained the right to receive a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)), payable as of the first of the month following the later of death or the date the Member would have attained age 55, and reduced in accordance with Section 4.04(c) if the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 65.34APPENDIX ERW - EARLY RETIREMENT WINDOWS ERW.1 Scope.

(the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan effective as of September 1, 1980. The Plan at that time was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.” The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, effective September 2, 1982. The Plan was again amended and restated effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took effect. The Plan was further amended effective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States of America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject to U.S. taxation. Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan document. The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in effect, and it sets forth the terms of the “DB Program.” Effective January 1, 2011, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together, the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee communications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP.” The DC Program was previously amended and restated, effective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country outside of their home country, (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available. The DC Program was again amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2019. As part of that amendment and restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to recognize same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners for certain purposes for Members actively employed or on authorized leave of absence on and after January 1, 2019. The DC Program was again amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2021. The DC Program is now hereby amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2023. At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’s individual employer. With respect to his employer, the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor. The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the 1United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States. 2ARTICLE II – DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION2.01 Definitions.Where the following words and phrases appear in this governing document for the DC Program, they shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context:(a) “Approved Transfer” means any of the following that are initiated or approved by the Corporation or (with the approval of the Corporation) by a Member’s Employer – (1) The Member’s transfer to employment based in the United States or its territories;(2) The Member’s secondment to a work location in the United States or its territories; (3) Any other change in the Member’s employment circumstances that will cause the Member to become a U.S. Person.(b) “Associated Company” means any company or undertaking which (i) is directly or indirectly controlled by or associated in business with the Corporation, and (ii) which has agreed, subject to the ongoing consent of the Vice President, to perform and observe the conditions, stipulations and provisions of the DC Program and to be included among the Employers under the DC Program. “Associated Companies” means all such companies or undertakings.(c) “Corporation” means PepsiCo, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of North Carolina, or its successor or successors.(d) “Dependant” means the person who shall receive the balance of a Member’s PIRP-DC Account upon the Member’s death.

The DC Program is also sometimes referred to as “PIRP-DC.”(g) “Distribution Valuation Date” means the date as specified by the Vice President from time to time as of which PIRP-DC Accounts are valued for purposes of distributions under Article VI. Currently, the Distribution Valuation Date for a Member is the month end that occurs just after the event specified in Article VI that triggers the Member’s distribution. Accordingly, if the trigger event occurs on December 30 of a year, the current Distribution Valuation Date is December 31 of that year, and if the 3trigger event occurs on December 31 of a year, the current Distribution Valuation Date is January 31 of the following year. The Vice President may change any current Distribution Valuation Date. Values are determined as of the close of a Distribution Valuation Date or, if such date is not a business day, as of the close of the preceding business day.

If the Member has entered into a civil union or similar government-recognized status that is valid at the Member’s death under the law of the location that is determined by the Vice President to be the Member’s principal residence, the Member’s Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the Member has entered into such status, provided that such individual submits a claim for benefits within 60 days of Member’s date of death (and if no such claim is submitted, the individual shall not be a Domestic Partner under this Section 2.01(i)(1)).(2)Benefits Enrollment. If the Member does not have a Domestic Partner pursuant to subsection (1) above, the Member’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual who, on the applicable date, was enrolled, as the Member’s domestic partner, in the Cigna International Health Program (or its successor) sponsored by the Corporation.

The Vice President shall have the discretion to designate as an Eligible Employee any individual employed by an Approved Employer on a part-time basis who, but for his part-time status, otherwise satisfies the requirements of this subsection. (k) “Eligible Spouse” means the individual to whom the Member is married, or to whom the Member was married on the date of his death. The determination of whether a Member is married shall be made by the Vice President based on the law of the location that is determined by the Vice President to be the Member’s principal residence; provided, however, that for purposes of the DC Program, a Member shall have only one Eligible Spouse.(l) “Employers” means the Corporation and any and every Associated Company or such one or more of any of them as the context shall determine or the circumstances require. “Employer” in relation to any person means whichever it is of the Employers in whose employment that person is or was at the relevant time or those Employers (if more than one) in whose employment he had been during the relevant period.

As of the Effective Date, the Interest Rate is the rate of interest on 30-year Treasury securities as prescribed by the Commissioner of the United States Internal Revenue Service for the month of September immediately preceding the first day of the Plan Year to which an Interest Credit relates. The Vice President shall have the discretion to change from time to time the basis for determining the Interest Rate as necessary to ensure that the Interest Rate is readily determinable and administrable, and that it can be reasonably expected to provide substantially a market rate of interest 5over time. At all times the Interest Rate shall not exceed a level that may be considered to constitute earnings under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(o). (p) “Member” means an Eligible Employee who has been admitted to Membership in the DC Program pursuant to Article III and who remains entitled to a benefit under the DC Program. In relation to each of the Employers, any reference to a Member means a Member in or formerly in its employment. References to “Membership” are references to the status of being a Member.

(u) “PIRP-DC Account” means the unfunded, notional account maintained for a Member on the books of the Member’s Employer that indicates the dollar amount that, as of any time, is credited under the DC Program for the benefit of the Member. The balance in such account shall be determined in accordance with interpretive principles and decisions applied by the Vice President.(v) “Salary” means (i) home notional base salary in the case of an Eligible Employee who is not paid on a United States payroll, and (ii) base salary plus annual bonus in the case of an Eligible Employee who is paid on a United States payroll. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Salary shall include home notional base salary plus annual bonus for Eligible Employees not paid on a United States payroll who become an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021. In the case of an Eligible Employee who is employed in a country other than the United States, the Vice President may authorize the Eligible Employee’s Salary to be increased to reflect an amount of notional bonus that is paid to such Eligible Employee. The determination of an Eligible Employee’s Salary in accordance with the preceding three sentences shall be made by the Vice President and shall be conclusive and binding on all Eligible Employees. (w) “Service” means the period during which an Eligible Employee is in employment with an Approved Employer, including employment with an Approved Employer before a break in service. Employment during a break in Service will only be counted as Service if the break lasts no more than 12 months. In the case of an individual who transfers from employment with an Employer that is not an Approved Employer to a position as an Eligible Employee of an Approved Employer, his pre-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as Service only with the approval of the Vice President. Similarly, in the case of an individual who transfers from employment with an Eligible Employee of an Approved Employer to other employment with an Employer, his post-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as 6Service only with the approval of the Vice President.

In addition, a person shall be considered a U.S. Person for purposes of Section 9.14 in any year for which the person is required by the United States Internal Revenue Code to file an individual income tax return, unless the Vice President determines that it is clear that the person has no U.S. source earned income from a member of the PepsiCo Organization for such year. (z) “Valuation date” means each business day, as determined by the Vice President, as of which Members’ PIRP-DC Accounts are valued (for purposes other than distributions under Article VI) in accordance with DC Program procedures that are then currently in effect. As of the Effective Date, the DC Program shall have a Valuation Date for all Members as of the last day of each Plan Year. In addition, to the extent provided in Section 4.02, the DC Program shall have a special Valuation Date prior to the end of a Plan Year for Active Members who have an Approved Transfer (and for certain Active Members who have a Status Change) as described in Section 4.02. In accordance with procedures that may be adopted by the Vice President, any current Valuation Date may be changed (but in such case adjustments shall apply in the operation of the DC Program as necessary to prevent duplicate or disproportionate benefits, as determined by the Vice President). Values are determined as of the close of a Valuation Date or, if such date is not a business day, as of the close of the preceding business day.(aa) “Vice President” means the Vice President, Global Benefits & Wellness of PepsiCo, Inc., but if such position is vacant or eliminated it shall be the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of the duties, if no one is fulfilling a majority), as such duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the position elimination. 2.02 Construction.(a) Gender and Number: Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, (i) a reference to one or more genders shall include a reference to all the other genders, and (ii) the singular may include the plural, and the plural may include the singular.. (b) Determining Periods of Years: For the purposes of the DC Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of 366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29th February) shall be deemed to constitute a year, but not so that in the calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a proportionate amount (i.e., a number of 7days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be included in the calculation. Where this document makes reference to months or parts of a year, or to any other period of time except a day, week or year the Vice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year.(c) Compounds of the Word “Here”: The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire DC Program, not to any particular provision or section. (d) Examples: Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).(e) Subdivisions of this Document: This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.8ARTICLE III – MEMBERSHIP3.01 Eligibility for Membership. Every person who the Vice President determines is an Eligible Employee shall be eligible for Membership.3.02 Admission to Membership. Every person who the Vice President determines is an Eligible Employee, and who is not during the relevant time a U.S. Person, shall, following the approval of his Membership by the Vice President, be admitted to Membership effective as of his Entry Date. For this purpose, the relevant time includes a sufficient period before the Eligible Employee’s Proposed Entry Date as is necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to Membership without the approval of the Vice President.3.03 Active and Inactive Membership. A Member shall be an Active Member during the period that he is – (a) employed as an Eligible Employee, (b) not a U.S. Person, and (c) currently approved for status as an Active Member by the Vice President. A Member shall be an Inactive Member during any period that he does not currently meet all of the requirements to be an Active Member. 9ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS4.01 Contributions.To the extent provided in subsections (a) and (b) below, the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a Member’s PIRP-DC Account, each determined by the Vice President as follows – (a) Pay Credit. To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Year, an individual must be an Active Member during such year. The amount of an Active Member’s Pay Credit for a Plan Year shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member’s annualized Salary in effect as of that year’s Valuation Date by the Active Member’s applicable percentage, which shall be one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%. Effective for any Eligible Employee who becomes an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021 and who does not have any Service completed while a U.S. Person, the amount of the Active Member’s Pay Credits shall be determined by the number of “points” attributed to the Active Member in accordance with the following:Such an Active Member’s points shall be determined by the sum of the Active Member’s age and years of Service, with each expressed in whole years and days.Otherwise, the Vice President shall specify the Active Member’s applicable percentage as of the Active Member’s Entry Date (or, if the Member ceases to be an Active Member, and then becomes an Active Member again, as of the date the Member again becomes an Active Member). For each subsequent Plan Year that the individual is an Active Member, the Vice President may specify a new applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Year. An Active Member shall cease receiving Pay Credits during any Plan Year as necessary to ensure that there is ongoing compliance with limitations set forth in Section 9.14. Specifications of an applicable percentage by the Vice President are made in the Vice President’s sole discretion, and at no time does an Eligible Employee have a legally binding right to be assigned any initial or increased applicable percentage. An Active Member’s Pay Credits with respect to Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2023 shall not be limited by the Code section 401(a)(17) limit. For Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 2023, an Active Member’s Pay Credits were limited to ensure that the Active Member’s Pay Credits do not exceed the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit in effect for such Plan Year.10(b) Interest Credit. To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Year, an individual must be either an Active Member or Inactive Member during such year, and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior Plan Year’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member’s Interest Credit shall be determined by the Vice President by multiplying the Interest Rate for the period since the last Valuation Date by the balance of the Member’s PIRP-DC Account as of such last Valuation Date. A Member’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the Vice President as soon as administratively practicable after each Valuation Date. If a Member has less than one full year of Active Membership since such last Valuation Date (e.g., as may apply in the Member’s first and last year of Membership), the Member’s Pay Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a Member has less than one full year of Membership since such last Valuation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member’s fractional year of Membership (e.g., as may apply in the Member’s last year of Membership). A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member’s days of Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Year by the total number of days in such Plan Year. A period of paid leave of absence during a Plan Year shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member’s Pay Credit for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence. However, a period of unpaid leave of absence during a Plan Year shall not be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member’s Pay Credit for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan Year containing the unpaid leave shall be prorated, or there shall be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member’s period of Active Membership during the Plan Year). In the event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member’s final year of Membership, the Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date (with proration based upon the Member’s fractional final year of Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by the Vice President shall be conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants). 4.02 Offsets.Notwithstanding Section 4.01, the Corporation may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become payable to or on behalf of a Member by the amount of any obligation of the Member to the Corporation or by the amount of – (a) Any material benefits accrued by the Member under a retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation or by any country, state, province or other political subdivision or locality, to the extent the Vice President determines that the benefit amount under such retirement plan is for Service or Salary that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program, and(b) Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Organization related to the Member’s termination of employment, to the extent the Vice President determines that the payment is reasonably related to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program. Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would be provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V, or the Member’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether a benefit is material and all other aspects of the application of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the Vice President. 11ARTICLE V – MEMBER ACCOUNTS5.01 Accounting for Members’ Interests.Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member’s PIRP-DC Account as of the Valuation Date to which such credits relate (or, in the case of Pay Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member’s final year of Membership, as of the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. A Member’s PIRP-DC Account is a bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer’s liability for such credits). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account, and no PIRP-DC Account shall be funded, insured or otherwise secured.5.02 Vesting. Subject to Sections 4.02, 9.08, and 9.14, a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his PIRP-DC Account upon completing 3 years of Service, or if earlier, upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the Employer or PepsiCo Organization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made by the Vice President in accordance with such standards as the Vice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question. The crediting of Pay Credits pursuant to this Plan (including the crediting of related earnings on such credits) shall not in any way exempt the Pay Credits and related earnings from the full application of the Company’s clawback and other forfeiture and recovery policies (“Clawback Policies”), as they are in effect from time to time. Accordingly, a Member’s Account shall be subject to forfeiture (and if paid out, to recovery) to the extent determined to be appropriate by the Vice President to give full effect to these Clawback Policies. Section 9.08 shall not be construed to reduce or impair the forfeiture and recovery rights provided by this Section 5.02.5.03 Special Vesting for Approved Transfers and Status Changes.(a) Automatic Special Vesting for Approved Transfers. Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have an Approved Transfer during a Plan Year, the Active Member shall automatically have special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member’s Approved Transfer, or (b) the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved Transfer. (b) Special Vesting for Status Changes. Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the Vice President apply special vesting to him as of the last business day before the Active Member’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and effective under the DC Program, the Active Member’s request and the Vice President’s approval of the request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies. Subject to the next sentence, the effect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and 12other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 5.03 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with this requirement.13ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS6.01 Distribution Rules Generally.A Member’s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member’s termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization or death, as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 respectively, subject to Section 4.06 (vesting). All distributions shall be made in cash.6.02 Distributions Upon Termination of Employment. If a Member’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first of the month that immediately follows the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date. In the case of a Member whose termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization occurs as a result of the Member becoming disabled, for purposes of this Section, the determination of whether such Member is disabled and the date on which such Member’s termination of employment is considered to occur shall be made by the Vice President.6.03 Distributions Upon Death. If a Member’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date. Amounts paid following a Member’s death shall be paid to the Member’s Dependant; provided, however, that if no Dependant designation is in effect at the time of the Member’s death (as determined by the Vice President), or if all persons designated as Dependants have predeceased the Member, then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable, or, if the Member does not have an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic Partner at the time of his death, to his estate. 6.04 Valuation.In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Member’s PIRP-DC Account shall continue to be credited with Interest Credits (and debited for expenses) as specified in Article V until the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date. 6.05 Designation of Dependant.A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the effective date of such election. If the Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s), any designation under this section of a Dependant(s) who is not the Member’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant(s) does not require consent by the Member’s Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant(s), and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Vice President, shall be made in writing on forms provided by the Vice President, and shall not be effective unless and until filed with the Vice President.14ARTICLE VII – ADMINISTRATION7.01 Authority to Administer Plan. (a) Administration by the Vice President: The Plan shall be administered by the Vice President, who shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the Vice President hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by the Vice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned. (b) Authority to Delegate: The Vice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the Vice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such action by the Vice President’s delegate or other designated person. 7.02 Facility of Payment.Whenever, in the opinion of the Vice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Vice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Vice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.7.03 Claims Procedure. The Vice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Vice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the Vice President, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the Vice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). All decisions and determinations made by the Vice President shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Vice President may consider the intent of the Corporation with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent.If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit or any other right related to the Plan (a “claim”), by or on behalf of a Member, putative Member, Dependant or putative Dependant (a “claimant”), is wholly or partially denied, the Vice President, or a party designated by the Vice President, will provide such claimant the claims procedure described in this section. The Vice President has the discretionary authority to modify 15the claims procedure described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the basic steps described in this Section. In the event of a claim by a claimant, the Vice President or the designated party shall provide the claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Vice President, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and(4) A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).If the Vice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Vice President will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision. Upon review, the Vice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Vice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the Vice President’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Vice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section and in accordance with Section 7.07. 7.04 Limitations on Actions.Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Member, Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively, a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Vice President on which payments shall commence; or (iii) when he has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or 16other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no effect on this two-year time frame. 7.05 Restriction of Venue.Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New York, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies, located nearest the Corporation’s headquarters.7.06 Effect of Specific References.Specific references in the Plan to the Vice President’s discretion shall create no inference that the Vice President’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.7.07 Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court.Before filing any Claim (as defined below in this Section), including a suit or other action, in a court or in another tribunal, a Claimant (as defined below in this Section) must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’s rights under the claims procedure in Section 7.03.(a) Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.07 is intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a Claim unless the purported Claimant took sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the purported Claimant was submitting a Claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) this Plan or applicable law requires the documents to be provided in response to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Vice President, (C) the Vice President fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor took sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the requestor was asserting a legal right to the documents. Accordingly, without limitation, a purported Claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Member shall not be deemed to have taken sufficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the Vice President that he is claiming to have been entitled to be a Member.(b) The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.06 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes (as defined below in this Section) that are not Claims (including those that a court or other tribunal might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Vice President may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential, and (iv) even if the Vice President has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Vice President, upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.03 that apply to claims for benefits).(c) The Vice President may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in 17these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.(d) For purposes of this Section 7.07, the following definitions apply.(1) A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter.(2) A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –(A) The interpretation of the Plan;(B) The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;(C) The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;(D) Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into effect;(E) The administration of the Plan;(F) Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;(G) A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;(H) An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any legal duty; or(I) Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Vice President, or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way.It is the Vice President’s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times consistently with any requirements of applicable law. Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan, the Plan imposes a contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with respect to any Claim (as defined above) in order to allow for the efficient and uniform resolution of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially substantial and unnecessary litigation expenses that exhaustion could obviate.(3) A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Eligible Employee, former Eligible Employee, Member, former Member, Dependant (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.18ARTICLE VIII – AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION8.01 Continuation of the Plan. While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely, it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance. The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the balance (determined as of the date of such amendment or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant, except to the extent the Member becomes entitled to an amount under another plan or practice maintained by an Employer. Specific forms (including times) of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence. The Corporation’s rights under this Article VIII shall be as broad as permissible under applicable law.8.02 Amendment. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive effect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.8.03 Termination. The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers. If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in effect for the benefit of the employees of the remaining Employers.19ARTICLE IX – MISCELLANEOUS9.01 Unfunded Plan.The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when due out of the Employer’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer. 9.02 Costs of the Plan.Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, charges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and management of the Plan shall be the costs, charges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost or expense is incurred.9.03 Temporary Absence of Member.If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, discharge, retirement or quitting (e.g., sickness, accident, layoff, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is absent, unless the Vice President determines otherwise. If the Member’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time member of the armed forces of any country or of any organization engaged in national service of any such country, he shall not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur.9.04 Taxes, Etc.In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the Vice President to be owing in respect of any benefit payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty.9.05 Nonguarantee of Employment.Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its employees, with or without cause. 9.06 No Right to Benefits.No person, whether or not being a Member, shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member’s termination of employment by an Employer, the resulting cessation of his Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any member of the PepsiCo Organization with respect to such termination.9.07 Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments. 20All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand charged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the Vice President that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member. The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member’s benefits and be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Organization whose receipt shall be a valid discharge for the same.Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable. Accordingly, any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –(1) A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a person, trust fund or entity).(2) The right to offset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however, reliance on this right is in the discretion of the Vice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the Plan’s rights under paragraph (1) above.(3) The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may correspond to such party’s present or future residence.Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the Vice President that are in furtherance of the Plan’s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way, including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.9.08 Prohibited Misconduct.(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Vice President determines that a Member has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid previously, being paid currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be recovered. Section 5.02 shall not be construed to reduce or impair the forfeiture rights provided by this Section 9.08, but the Vice President shall have the authority to 21reduce the forfeitures that would apply under this Section to the extent necessary to avoid an inappropriate duplication (determined in the Vice President’s sole discretion) of the forfeitures applicable under Section 5.02. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08. (b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly, by a Member shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the Member’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Organization.(2) The Member, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member’s recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Organization employee to leave the PepsiCo Organization’s employment or to accept any position with any other entity.(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Organization. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his positions with the PepsiCo Organization, which might be of any value to a competitor of the PepsiCo Organization, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the PepsiCo Organization or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo Organization’s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies. (4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Organization’s best interests, including violating the Corporation’s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the PepsiCo Organization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.22Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or in any other confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject as a result of the Member’s employment with the Company, nothing shall prohibit the Member from, without notice to the Company, communicating with government agencies, providing information to government agencies, participating in government agency investigations, filing a complaint with government agencies, or testifying in government agency proceedings concerning any possible legal violations or from receiving any monetary award for information provided to a government agency. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further, notwithstanding any confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Organization is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – in-home and commercial beverage systems, carbon dioxide gas cylinders, carbon dioxide gas refills, consumables, and ready-to-drink beverages, including without limitation, carbonated soft drinks, tea, water, juices, juice drinks, juice products sports drinks, coffee drinks, alcoholic beverages, and energy drinks; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, fruit and vegetable snacks, dips and spreads, sweet snacks, meat snacks, granola, nutrition and cereal bars, and cookies; hot cereals and ready-to-eat cereals; pancake mixes and pancake syrup; grain-based food products; pasta products; sports performance nutrition products, including without limitation, energy, protein, carbohydrate, nutrition and meal replacement chews, bars, powders, gels, drinks or drink mixes; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo Organization during the Member’s employment with the PepsiCo Organization.9.09 Notices.Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be sufficiently given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the Vice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be sufficient if such notice is delivered to the Member’s last known address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method (e.g., electronically) that the Vice President determines is reasonably available to the Member.239.10 Plan Documentation. Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.9.11 Currency of Payment.Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency," as approved by the Vice President. The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the Vice President from time to time.9.12 Governing Law.The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York and any applicable federal law as would be applied in cases that arise in the United States District Courts that sit in the State of New York. 9.13 Exemption from ERISA.The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States.9.14 Exemption from Section 409A.In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section 409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, effective for any period to which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively, a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person. However, Interest Credits may be provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S. Person, but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on such Pay Credits). Accordingly, no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined, following the close of such year, that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the Vice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year. In other cases, the Member’s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the Vice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement. Further, to ensure the continuation of such exemption from 24Section 409A, the preceding sentence shall be applied and given overriding effect notwithstanding any other provision or language in this Plan. 9.15 Electronic Signatures. The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to this Plan or any other document or record to be signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Corporation Vice President, Eligible Employee, Dependant, or any other individual shall be deemed to include electronic signatures and the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law.25ARTICLE X – SIGNATURE The PepsiCo International Retirement Plan, DC Program document, as amended and restated, is hereby adopted as of this 11th day of December, 2023, to be effective as of January 1, 2023 or as otherwise stated herein.

PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B thereof).1989 Restatement. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989. 409A Program Document 2005 Restatement. The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally, benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or materially modified within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”). Amendments to the 2005 Restatement. The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), effective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011. The PBG PEP document that was in effect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger, except for certain administrative provisions that are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”) - 1 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programunder either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP Document. 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Restatements. This restatement of the 409A Program Document is effective as of January 1, 2023. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated effective as of January 1, 2022, and prior to that, effective as of January 1, 2022, January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2017. Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program. All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to the 409A Program (i.e., generally, benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially modified thereafter within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together, this document and the document for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single plan. However, amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.Freeze of the Salaried Plan. In general, the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that would accrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the Salaried Plan. As a result, a Participant’s accrual of Plan benefits and a Participant’s growing into certain benefit enhancements (such as more favorable early commencement factors) are generally tied to the Participant’s accrual of benefits and growing into benefit enhancements under the Salaried Plan. For certain - 2 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramParticipants, there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the “PEP Guarantee”) or the Appendix that provide a benefit accrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of certain Code limitations to the Salaried Plan. Regardless, however, the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan effective as of that time. In addition, the Salaried Plan’s operational rules with respect to the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 govern the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 under this Plan.- 3 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramARTICLE IIDefinitions and Construction2.1 Definitions: This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below. Where the following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context.Accrued Benefit: The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with Article V, based on the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of determination.Actuarial Equivalent: Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the factors set forth below. The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner. In the event the Plan is amended to provide new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless specifically adopted by the amendment.(1) Annuities and Inflation Protection: To determine the amount of a Pension payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity, as an annuity with inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity, the Plan Administrator shall select the factors that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the Appendix). Thereafter, the Plan Administrator shall review - 4 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programsuch factors for forms of payment (including for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall amend such factors in its discretion. In general, a Participant shall have no right to have any of the actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit (or any portion thereof), except to the extent that a particular factor is currently in effect at the time it is to be applied under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment selected by the Plan Administrator from time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already accrued benefits, and without regard to the actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such purpose. However, in adjusting benefits under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that become effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, the right to receive a benefit that is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same extent (and in the same manner) as applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors. For this purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor, period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(b) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period certain or other death benefit, and Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the - 5 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programelected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to similarly situated participants).SCHEDULE 1*As this term is defined in the Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent”(2) Lump Sums: To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension under Section 4.6, or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension under Section 4.12, the lump sum equivalent factors currently applicable to lump sum distributions under the Salaried Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance with paragraph (1) above.(3) Other Cases: To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Participant in other cases, the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan. In this respect, the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be effective hereunder for Annuity Starting - 6 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramDates (as defined under this Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to change in accordance with paragraph (1) above.Annuity: A Pension payable as a series of monthly payments for at least the life of the Participant.Annuity Starting Date: The Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the first period for which an amount is payable under this Plan as an annuity or in any other form. A Participant who: (1) is reemployed after his initial Annuity Starting Date, and (2) is entitled to benefits hereunder after his reemployment, shall have a subsequent Annuity Starting Date for such benefits only to the extent provided in Section 6.3(b).Cashout Limit: The annual dollar limit on elective deferrals under Code section 402(g)(1)(B), as in effect from time to time.Code: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. All references herein to particular Code Sections shall also refer to any successor provisions and shall include all related regulations, interpretations and other guidance.Company: PepsiCo, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of North Carolina or its successor or successors.Covered Compensation: “Covered Compensation” as that term is defined in Part B of the Salaried Plan.Credited Service: The period of a Participant’s employment, calculated in accordance with Section 3.3, which is counted for purposes of determining the amount of benefits payable to, or on behalf of, the Participant.- 7 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramDisability Retirement Pension: The Retirement Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.5.Early 409A Retirement Pension: The 409A Retirement Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.2.Elapsed Time Service: The period of time beginning with a Participant’s first date of employment with the PepsiCo Organization and ending with the Participant’s Final Separation from Service, irrespective of any breaks in service between those two dates. By way of illustration, if a Participant began employment with the PepsiCo Organization on January 1, 2000, left the employment of the PepsiCo Organization from January 1, 2001 until December 31, 2004, and was then reemployed by the PepsiCo Organization on January 1, 2005 until he had a Final Separation from Service on December 31, 2008, the Participant would have eight years of Elapsed Time Service as of his Final Separation from Service.Eligible Domestic Partner. The definition in this Section 2.1 is effective for applicable dates on and after January 1, 2019, and applies solely to a Participant who is actively employed by, or on an Authorized Leave of Absence from, a member of the PepsiCo Organization on or after January 1, 2019. For other dates or Participants, see Appendix Article H.(1)Definition. For applicable dates on or after January 1, 2019, “Eligible Domestic Partner” means an individual who is of the same sex or opposite sex as the Participant and who satisfies paragraph (a), (b) or (c), subject to the additional rules set forth in paragraph (e).- 8 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(a)Civil Union. If on the applicable date the Participant has entered into a civil union that is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the Participant has entered into such a civil union.(b)Enrollment in Health Benefits. If the Participant does not have an Eligible Domestic Partner pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual who, on the applicable date, is enrolled in any of the Company’s health benefit options as the Participant’s domestic partner. (c)Other Acceptable Evidence of Partnership. If on the applicable date a Participant does not have an Eligible Domestic Partner under paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual who satisfies such criteria of domestic partnership as the Plan Administrator has specified in writing.(d)No Eligible Domestic Partner Except as Described Above. If on the applicable date a Participant does not have an Eligible Domestic Partner under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) above, such Participant is not eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner. (e)Additional Rules. The term “Eligible Domestic Partner” does not apply to a Participant’s Eligible Spouse. A Participant is not permitted to have more than one Eligible Domestic Partner at any point in - 9 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programtime, and a Participant who has an Eligible Spouse is not permitted to have an Eligible Domestic Partner. (2)Terms Used in this Definition. For purposes of the definition of “Eligible Domestic Partner” in this Section 2.1, the following definitions apply: “applicable date” means the earlier of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date and date of death, and “state” means any domestic or foreign jurisdiction having the legal authority to sanction civil unions.Eligible Spouse: The spouse of a Participant to whom the Participant is considered lawfully married for purposes of Federal tax law on the earlier of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date or the date of the Participant’s death and who, solely for periods before September 16, 2013, is of the opposite sex.Employee: An individual who qualifies as an “Employee” as that term is defined in Part B of the Salaried Plan.Employer: An entity that qualifies as an “Employer” as that term is defined in Part B of the Salaried Plan.ERISA: Public Law No. 93-406, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including any amendments thereto, any similar subsequent federal laws, and any rules and regulations from time to time in effect under any of such laws.FICA Amount: The Participant’s share of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed on the 409A Pension and Pre-409A Pension of the Participant under Code Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2).- 10 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program409A Program: The program described in this document. The term “409A Program” is used to identify the portion of the Plan that is subject to Section 409A.Guiding Principles Regarding Benefit Plan Committee Appointments: The guiding principles as set forth in Common Appendix Article PAC to be applied by the Chair of the PAC when selecting the members of the PAC.Highest Average Monthly Earnings: “Highest Average Monthly Earnings” as that term is defined in the Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to the limitation imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code (as such limitation is interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a Participant receives, during an authorized leave of absence related to a Company severance program or agreement, earnings that would be counted as Highest Average Monthly Earnings if they were received during a period of active service, but that will be received after the Participant’s Separation from Service, the Plan Administrator may provide for determining the Participant’s 409A Pension at Separation from Service by projecting the benefit the Participant would have if all such earnings were taken into account under the Plan (any such determination shall divide the projected earnings between Plan Years as determined by the Plan Administrator, in order to avoid any bunching of the earnings in a Plan Year).Key Employee: The individuals identified in accordance with the following paragraphs.(1) In General. Any Participant who at any time during the applicable year is:- 11 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(i) An officer of any member of the PepsiCo Organization having annual compensation greater than $215,000 (as adjusted for the applicable year under Code Section 416(i)(1));(ii) A 5-percent owner of any member of the PepsiCo Organization; or(iii) A 1-percent owner of any member of the PepsiCo Organization having annual compensation of more than $150,000.For purposes of subparagraph (i) above, no more than 50 employees identified in the order of their annual compensation shall be treated as officers. For purposes of this Section, annual compensation means compensation as defined in Treas. Reg. §1.415(c)-2(a), without regard to Treas. Reg. §§1.415(c)-2(d), 1.415(c)-2(e), and 1.415(c)-2(g). The Plan Administrator shall determine who is a Key Employee in accordance with Code Section 416(i) (provided, that Code Section 416(i)(5) shall not apply in making such determination), and provided further than the applicable year shall be determined in accordance with Section 409A and that any modification of the foregoing definition that applies under Section 409A shall be taken into account.(2) Applicable Year. Effective from and after December 31, 2007, the Plan Administrator shall identify Key Employees as of the last day of each calendar year, based on compensation for such year, and such designation shall be effective for purposes of this Plan for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1st of the next following calendar year (e.g., the Key - 12 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramEmployee identification by the Plan Administrator as of December 31, 2008 shall be effective for the period from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010).(3) Rule of Administrative Convenience. Effective beginning with the December 31, 2017 identification date, in addition to the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall treat all other employees classified as Leadership Group 6 and above on the applicable identification date prescribed in paragraph (2) as Key Employees effective for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1st of the next following calendar year (however, from the April 1, 2008 effective date through February 25, 2010, Band IV and above applied in lieu of Leadership Group 6 and above); provided that if this would result in counting more than 200 individuals as Key Employees as of any such determination date, then the number treated as Key Employees will be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees otherwise added by this paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest to the highest.(4) Identification of Key Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010. For the period between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified by combining the lists of Key Employees of all members of the PepsiCo Organization as in effect immediately prior to February 26, 2010. The foregoing method of identifying Key Employees is intended to comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(i)(6)(i), which authorizes the use of an alternative method of identifying specified employees that complies with Treas.

The term may also be used as a verb (i.e., “Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’s transfer to an entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the extent permitted by Section 409A. A Participant’s “Final Separation from Service” is the date of his Separation from Service that most recently precedes his Annuity Starting Date; provided, however, that to the extent a Participant is reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with respect to any benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles shall generally apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:(1) A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires, or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company. Whether a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).- 25 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(2) An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such leave does not exceed a period of six months or, if longer, such longer period of time during which a right to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month period.(3) If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, the services provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.Service: The period of a Participant’s employment calculated in accordance with Section 3.2 for purposes of determining his entitlement to benefits under the Plan.- 26 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramSingle Life Annuity: A level monthly Annuity payable to a Participant for his life only, with no survivor benefits to his Eligible Spouse or any other person.Single Lump Sum: The distribution of a Participant’s total 409A Pension in the form of a single payment, which payment shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s 409A Pension as of the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date (or Late Retirement Date, if applicable), but not less than the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s 409A Pension as of the Participant’s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.Social Security Act: The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability.

The term “409A Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Vested Pension that is derived from the 409A Program. The term “Pre-409A Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Vested Pension that is derived from the Pre-409A Program.- 27 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program2.2 Construction: The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.(a) Gender and Number: Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, (i) a reference to one or more genders shall include a reference to all the other genders, and (ii) the singular may include the plural, and the plural may include the singular.(b) Compounds of the Word “Here”: The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or section.(c) Examples: Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passages of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limits on its breadth of application).(d) Subdivisions of the Plan Document: This Plan document is divided and subdivided using the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and sub-clauses.

Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses.

A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.- 29 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramARTICLE IIIParticipation and Service3.1 Participation: An Employee shall be a Participant in the Plan during the period:(a) When he would be currently entitled to receive a Pension under the Plan if his employment terminated at such time, or(b) When he would be so entitled but for the vesting requirement of Section 4.7.It is expressly contemplated that an Employee, who is entitled to receive a Pension under the Plan as of a particular time, may subsequently cease to be entitled to receive a Pension under the Plan. An individual’s entitlement to receive a Pension under the Plan is subject to all exclusions from eligibility that apply under the Salaried Plan and, therefore, all such exclusions shall be given effect in determining eligibility under the Plan. 3.2 Service: A Participant’s entitlement to a Pension or, in the event the Participant dies before commencing a benefit hereunder, either a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension for his Eligible Spouse or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension for his Eligible Domestic Partner, shall be determined under Article IV based upon his period of Service.

(b) Leaves of Absence. If a Participant’s period of Service (as so determined) would extend beyond the Participant’s Separation from Service date because of an authorized leave of absence related to a Company severance program or agreement, the Plan Administrator may provide for determining the Participant’s 409A Pension at Separation from Service by projecting the benefit the Participant would have if all such Service were taken into account under the Plan.3.3 Credited Service: Subject to the next two sentences, the amount of a Participant’s Pension, Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension shall be based upon the Participant’s period of Credited Service, as determined under Article III of Part B of the Salaried Plan.

(b) Leaves of Absence. If a Participant’s period of Credited Service (as so determined) would extend beyond the Participant’s Separation from Service date because of an authorized leave of absence related to a Company severance program or agreement, the Plan Administrator may provide for determining the Participant’s 409A Pension at Separation from Service by projecting the benefit the Participant would have if all such Service were taken into account under the Plan.- 31 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramARTICLE IVRequirements for BenefitsA Participant shall be eligible to receive a Pension and a surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable, shall be eligible for certain survivor benefits as provided in this Article.

The accrual of an Accrued Benefit pursuant to this Plan shall not in any way exempt the Accrued Benefit from the full application of the Company’s clawback and other forfeiture and recovery policies (“Clawback Policies”), as they are in effect from time to time. Accordingly, a Participant’s Accrued Benefit shall be subject to forfeiture (and if paid out, to recovery) to the extent determined to be appropriate by the Plan Administrator to give full effect to these Clawback Policies.

In the case of other Participants, the PEP Guarantee shall not apply.(a) Eligibility: A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings” means the Participant’s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year, within the meaning of the Salaried Plan as in effect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer.(b) PEP Guarantee Formula: The amount of a Participant’s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).(1) Formulas: The amount of a Participant’s Pension under this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) below. However, if the Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts - 44 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programdetermined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a Vested Pension.(i) Formula A: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:(A) 3 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for the first 10 years of Credited Service, plus(B) 1 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for each year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less(C) 1-2/3 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.In determining the amount of a Vested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Separation from Service, and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’s actual years of Credited Service on his Separation from Service and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have - 45 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programearned had he remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.(ii) Formula B: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater of (A) or (B) below:(A) 1-1/2 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount, or(B) 3 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount.In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be calculated on the basis of the Participant’s Credited Service (determined in accordance with Section 3.3(c)(3) of Part B of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability.(2) Calculation: The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:(i) Surviving Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s Annuity: Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, the Participant’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible - 46 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramDomestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below.(A) For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.(B) For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.(ii) Reductions: The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’s PEP Guarantee.- 47 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(A) If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement Date.(B) If the Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any Pre Retirement Spouse’s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for any Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s coverage shall apply.(C) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner, that is greater than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.(D) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that provides a survivor annuity for a - 48 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programbeneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner. In this instance, the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’s life.(E) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance, the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.(iii) Lump Sum Conversion: The amount of the Retirement Pension determined under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the PEP Guarantee’s purpose to preserve substantially the value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of the Plan and the 409A Plan’s design that offers alternative annuities that are considered actuarial equivalent - 49 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programfor purposes of Section 409A (taking into account, without limitation, the special rule for subsidized joint and survivor annuities in Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(b)(ii)(C)).5.3 Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension: The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below.(a) Calculation: An Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension shall be equal to:(1) The Eligible Spouse’s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, reduced by(2) The Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, and then further reduced by (but not below zero)(3) The Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension derived from the Pre-409A Program.(b) Basis for Determining: The Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension amount in subsection (a) above shall be determined on a basis (i) that takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement, and (ii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial Equivalent as appropriate under the circumstances and pursuant to rules of the Plan Administrator, including to take account the time and form of any prior payments.(c) Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.- 50 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(1) An Eligible Spouse’s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the greater of:(i) The amount of the Eligible Spouse’s pre-retirement spouse’s pension determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan; or(ii) The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension determined under subsection (c).In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated as if payable as of what would be the Normal Retirement Date of the Participant related to the Eligible Spouse.

For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals.(a) Adjustments for Rehired Participants: This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the Participant’s PEP Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A. For this purpose and to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A, the PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.(b) Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans: If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by order of a - 53 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programcourt, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), then the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder, the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.(c) No Benefit Offsets That Would Violate Section 409A. Effective as of January 1, 2009, if a Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the “Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.5 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, such Transfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the Participant’s Total Pension under Section 5.1(c)(1) above only to the extent the application of such rule to the Participant’s 409A Pension will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on offsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into effect in a particular situation, the limit on offsets in the prior sentence will not apply.- 54 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program5.5 Excludable Employment: An executive who has signed a written agreement with the Company pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan (even if the individual otherwise meets the definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in the Plan, shall not thereafter become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment (whichever applies). Written agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive becomes eligible for or begins participation in the Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is deemed effective by the Company. This Section 5.5 shall apply with respect to agreements that are entered into on or after January 1, 2009.5.6 Pre-409A Pension: A Participant’s Pre-409A Pension is the portion of the Participant’s Pension that is grandfathered under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i) and (iv). Principles similar to those applicable under – (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall apply in determining the Pre-409A Pension under this section.5.7 Offsets: Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would be payable to or on behalf of a Participant by the amount of any obligation of the Participant to the Company that is or becomes due and payable, provided that (1) the obligation of the Participant to the Company was incurred during the employment relationship, (2) the reduction during any Plan Year may not exceed the amount allowed under Code Section 409A and (3) the reduction is made at the same time and in the same amount as the obligation otherwise would have been due and collectable from the Participant. In addition, in the event a Participant has earned a 409A Benefit (a “Prior 409A Benefit”) that was paid before, or will become payable either before or under different payment terms than, an additional 409A Benefit for the Participant, the - 55 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programcalculation of the Participant’s additional 409A Benefit shall include an offset for the Prior 409A Benefit. This offset shall be determined as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A Benefit on a basis that (i) takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary, the relative value of forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts the offset to its Actuarial Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and in accordance with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator.

Effective January 1, 2014, in any case in which the form of payment of a Participant’s 409A Pension is determined by his marital status on his Annuity Starting Date, the Plan Administrator shall assume the Participant is unmarried on his Annuity Starting Date unless the Participant provides notice to the Plan prior to his Annuity Starting Date, which is deemed sufficient and satisfactory by the Plan Administrator, that he is married. The Participant shall give such notification to the Plan Administrator when he makes the election described in subsection (a) above or in accordance with such other procedures that are established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (if any). Notwithstanding the two prior sentences, the Plan Administrator may adopt rules that provide for a different outcome than specified above.6.4 Special Rules for Survivor Options: The following special rules shall apply for the survivor options available under Section 6.2.(a) Effect of Certain Deaths: If a Participant makes an election under Section 6.3(a) to receive his 409A Retirement Pension in the form of an optional Annuity that includes a benefit for a surviving beneficiary under Section 6.2 and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of the optional form of payment in Section - 68 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies prior to the Annuity Starting Date of such Annuity, the election shall be disregarded.

A Participant (whether active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to his Annuity Starting Date.

For periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however, shall not be delayed under the preceding sentence if the Participant’s 409A Vested Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).(c) Interest Paid for Delay.

The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1) shall have no effect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).(b) Reduction of 409A Pension. To reflect the payment of a Participant’s FICA Amount and any related income tax liability, the Participant’s 409A Pension shall be reduced, effective as of the date for payment of the lump sum in accordance with subsection (a) above, with such reduction being the Actuarial Equivalent of the lump sum payment used to satisfy the Participant’s FICA Amount and related income tax withholding. It is expressly contemplated that this reduction may - 72 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programoccur effective as of a date that is after the date payment of a Participant’s 409A Pension commences.(A) No Effect on Commencement of 409A Pension. The Participant’s 409A Pension shall commence in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The lump sum payment to satisfy the Participant’s FICA Amount and related income tax withholding shall not affect the time of payment of the Participant’s actuarially reduced 409A Pension, including not affecting any required delay in payment to a Participant who is classified as a Key Employee.- 73 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramARTICLE VIIAdministration7.1 Authority to Administer Plan: The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, which shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in writing, including the Participant’s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator’s interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to the Company or the Plan Administrator.7.2 Facility of Payment: Whenever, in the Plan Administrator’s opinion, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.7.3 Claims Procedure: The Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret - 74 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programthe Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the Participant (or other applicant) is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the breadth of the Plan Administrator’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, will provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section. The Plan Administrator has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the steps described below. A claim shall be made in writing or in such other form as is acceptable to the Plan Administrator. Within a 90-day response period - 75 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programfollowing the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant of:(a) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and(d) A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process and a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on review).If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator, or the designated party, within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review, the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim, and the Plan Administrator’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days - 76 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programafter receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request ad free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits. Any special extension, which is required by ERISA and applies to one or more deadlines applicable under this claims procedure, shall apply under this Plan to the same extent that special extension applies under the Salaried Plan. Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.7.4 Effect of Specific References: Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator’s discretion shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.- 77 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program7.5 Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court : Before filing any Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.(a) Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a Claim unless the purported claimant took sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the purported claimant was submitting a Claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) ERISA requires the documents to be provided in response to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Plan Administrator, (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor took sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was asserting an ERISA right to the documents. Accordingly, but without limitation, a purported claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Participant shall not be deemed to have taken sufficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that he is claiming to have been entitled to be a Participant.- 78 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(b) In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.(c) The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.3 that apply to claims for benefits).(d) The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.(e) For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the purported Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the purported Claimant was submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) the Claimant is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested - 79 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programdocument from the Plan Administrator at the time and in the form requested, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Plan Administrator, (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was actually entitled to receive the requested documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Claimant must provide sufficient information to place the Plan Administrator on notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and (E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable claims of which the Claimant has informed the Plan Administrator.(f) For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply.(i) A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter.(ii) A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –(A) The interpretation of the Plan(B) The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan(C) The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;- 80 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(D) Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into effect;(E) The administration of the Plan;(F) Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;(G) A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;(H) An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or(I) Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan Administrator, or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way.It is the Plan Administrator’s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times consistently with ERISA. Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan, the Plan imposes a contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with respect to any Claim (as defined above) in order to allow for the efficient and uniform resolution of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially substantial and unnecessary litigation expenses that exhaustion could obviate. - 81 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(iii) A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant, beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, domestic partner, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.7.6 Limitations on Actions: Any claim filed under section 7.3 and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity (collectively, a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner’s cause of action first accrues. (a) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are the basis of his claim, or (iv) the date when the benefit was first paid, provided, or denied. (b) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to constitute interference with ERISA-protected rights. - 82 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program(c) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to any other claim, action or suit not covered by subsection (a) or (b) above must be brought within two years of the date when the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to give rise to the claim, action or suit.Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications pursuant to or following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3 shall have no effect on this two-year time frame.7.7 Restriction on Venue: Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, effective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1, 2011.- 83 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramARTICLE VIIIMiscellaneous8.1 Nonguarantee of Employment: Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the employment of an Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or without cause.8.2 Nonalienation of Benefits: Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder, including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company. The Company shall not in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits hereunder.8.3 Unfunded Plan: The Company’s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’s general funds. To the extent the Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.8.4 Action by the Company: Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the - 84 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A ProgramBoard of Directors, with a report of any actions taken by it to the Board of Directors. In addition, such action may be made by any other person or persons duly authorized by resolution of said Board to take such action.8.5 Indemnification: Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the Company shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.8.6 Compliance with Section 409A:(a) General: It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further, in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company, the Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or determinations made in good faith.(b) Non-duplication of benefits: In the interest of clarity, and to determine benefits in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest Average Monthly Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any similar provision, no duplication of benefits may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a specific provision of the Plan provides for recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable earnings or service) and this same - 85 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programelement is or could be recognized in some other way under the Plan, the specific provision of the Plan shall govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate recognition of such element under any other provision of the Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision shall govern over any contrary provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.8.7 Section 457A: To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’s Pension, the following shall apply to a Participant who transfers to a work location outside of the United States to provide services to a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is neither a United States corporation nor a pass-through entity that is wholly owned by a United States corporation (“Covered Transfer”):(a) The Participant shall automatically vest in his or her Pension as of the last business day before the Covered Transfer;(b) From and after the Covered Transfer, any benefit accruals or other increases or enhancements to the Participant’s Pension relating to –(1) Service, or(2) The attainment of a specified age while in the employment of the PepsiCo Organization (“age attainment”),(collectively, “Benefit Enhancement”) will not be credited to the Participant until the last day of the Plan Year in which the Participant renders the Service or has the age attainment that results in such Benefit Enhancement, and then only to the extent permissible under subsection (c) below at that time; and(c) The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit Enhancement that relates to Service or age attainment - 86 -PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Programfrom and after the Covered Transfer to the extent such Benefit Enhancement would constitute compensation that is includable in income under Section 457A.Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant who has a Covered Transfer if, prior to the Covered Transfer, the Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually, to a group of similar Participants, to Participants generally, or in any other way that causes the communication to apply to the Participant – i.e., an “applicable communication”) that these subsections do not apply to the Covered Transfer in question. Subsection (b) shall cease to apply as of the earlier of – (i) the date the Participant returns to service for a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a United States corporation or a pass-through entity that is wholly owned by a United States corporation, or (ii) the effective date for such cessation that is stated in an applicable communication.8.8 Authorized Transfers: If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization shall remain with the Company, except as otherwise expressly provided by an agreement between the Company and the Participant’s new employer.8.9 Electronic Signatures: The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to this Plan or any other document or record to be signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Company, Plan Administrator, Employee or other individual shall be deemed to include electronic
