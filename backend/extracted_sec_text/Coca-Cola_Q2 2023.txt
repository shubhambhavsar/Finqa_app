Table of ContentsFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report contains information that may constitute “forward-looking statements.” Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and net income per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the potential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service could significantly change; those described in Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022; and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.1Part I.

They do not include all information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of The Coca-Cola Company for the year ended December 31, 2022.When used in these notes, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. Sales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters typically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.Each of our quarterly reporting periods, other than the fourth quarter, ends on the Friday closest to the last day of the corresponding quarterly calendar period. The second quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2022 ended on June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. Our fourth quarter and our fiscal year end on December 31 regardless of the day of the week on which December 31 falls.Advertising CostsThe Company’s accounting policy related to advertising costs for annual reporting purposes is to expense production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred.For quarterly reporting purposes, we allocate our estimated full year marketing expenditures that benefit multiple quarters to each of those quarters. We use the proportion of each quarter’s actual unit case volume to the estimated full year unit case volume as the basis for the allocation. This methodology results in our marketing expenditures being recognized at a standard rate per unit case. At the end of each quarter, we review our estimated full year unit case volume and our estimated full year marketing expenditures that benefit multiple quarters in order to evaluate if a change in estimate is necessary. The impact of any change in the full year estimate is recognized in the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. Our full year marketing expenditures are not impacted by this interim accounting policy.Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash EquivalentsWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.The following tables provide a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that constitute the total amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):1Amounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4.2Amounts include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2. 61Amounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4.2Amounts include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURESAcquisitionsOur Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $43 million and $6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively.DivestituresProceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 totaled $320 million and $218 million, respectively, which primarily related to sales of our ownership interests in certain equity method investees. Assets and Liabilities Held for SaleAs of June 30, 2023, the Company’s bottling operations in Bangladesh met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record the related assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair values less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying values, the related assets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying values. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. In December 2022, the Company received cash proceeds of $823 million in advance of refranchising its bottling operations in Vietnam. This advance was included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. The Company refranchised its bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023 and recognized a net gain of $439 million as a result of the sale, which was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income during the six months ended June 30, 2023.The following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale and were included in the line items prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):7NOTE 3: NET OPERATING REVENUES The following tables present net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by line of business (in millions):Refer to Note 17 for disclosures of net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate.NOTE 4: INVESTMENTSEquity SecuritiesThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):8The calculation of net unrealized gains and losses recognized during the period related to equity securities still held at the end of the period is as follows (in millions): Debt SecuritiesOur debt securities consisted of the following (in millions):The carrying values of our debt securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):The contractual maturities of these available-for-sale debt securities as of June 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):The Company expects that actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities above because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.9The sale and/or maturity of available-for-sale debt securities resulted in the following realized activity (in millions):Captive Insurance CompaniesIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive’s solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,546 million and $1,378 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.NOTE 5: INVENTORIESInventories consisted of the following (in millions): NOTE 6: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following table presents the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part of a hedging relationship (in millions):1All of the Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets after considering the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. Current disclosure requirements mandate that derivatives must also be disclosed without reflecting the impact of master netting agreements and cash collateral. Refer to Note 16 for the net presentation of the Company’s derivative instruments.2Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to the estimated fair value.10The following table presents the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments that were not designated as hedging instruments (in millions):1All of the Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets after considering the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. Current disclosure requirements mandate that derivatives must also be disclosed without reflecting the impact of master netting agreements and cash collateral. Refer to Note 16 for the net presentation of the Company’s derivative instruments.2Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to the estimated fair value.Credit Risk Associated with DerivativesWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company’s master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same counterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative financial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on changes in the fair value of the instruments. The Company classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability position. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. Cash Flow Hedging StrategyThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in the fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three years.The Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside of the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $8,969 million and $5,510 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.11The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt and other monetary assets or liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For this hedging program, the Company recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for the Company’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities was $958 million as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.The Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments are designated as part of the Company’s commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were $59 million and $35 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. We manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements and designates these instruments as part of the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company’s future interest payments. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program was $500 million as of June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge. The following tables present the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings (in millions):12As of June 30, 2023, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net losses of $14 million from the pretax amount recorded in AOCI as the anticipated cash flows occur.Fair Value Hedging StrategyThe Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is reflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the hedged item has matured or has been extinguished. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of this type were $13,592 million and $13,425 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.The following tables summarize the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges had on earnings (in millions):13The following table summarizes the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to hedged items in fair value hedging relationships (in millions):1Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments does not include changes due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.In June 2023, the Company amended the terms of its interest rate swap agreements to implement a forward-looking interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in place of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Since the interest rate swap agreements were affected by reference rate reform, the Company applied the expedients and exceptions provided to preserve the past presentation of its derivatives without de-designating the existing hedging relationships. All amendments to interest rate swap agreements were executed with the existing counterparties and did not change the notional amounts, maturity dates, or other critical terms of the hedging relationships.Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations StrategyThe Company uses forward contracts and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in a number of foreign operations. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI, to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the carrying values of the designated portions of the non-derivative financial instruments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in net foreign currency translation adjustments. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the period of change. The following table summarizes the notional values and pretax impact of changes in the fair values of instruments designated as net investment hedges (in millions):The Company did not reclassify any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022. In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022. The cash inflows and outflows associated with the Company’s derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.Economic (Non-Designated) Hedging StrategyIn addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity exposure. Although these derivatives are not designated and/or do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.The Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related to certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability 14in U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold or other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $5,976 million and $4,902 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.The Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we did not have any interest rate contracts used as economic hedges.The Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type were $345 million and $336 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The following tables present the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments had on earnings (in millions):NOTE 7: SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAMOur current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program, which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity 15related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount of obligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions under the SCF program was $1,354 million and $1,351 million, respectively. NOTE 8: DEBT AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTSLoans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $4,643 million and $2,146 million, respectively, in outstanding commercial paper borrowings.During the six months ended June 30, 2023, our bottling operations in Africa extinguished prior to maturity U.S. dollar term loans with a total principal amount of $121 million, with variable interest rates ranging from the three-month LIBOR plus 2.950 percent to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.000 percent. Additionally, the bottling operations extinguished prior to maturity a U.S. dollar revolving facility of $40 million, with a variable interest rate of SOFR plus 2.344 percent.NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES GuaranteesAs of June 30, 2023, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $1,105 million, of which $95 million was related to variable interest entities. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. Concentrations of Credit RiskWe believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.Legal ContingenciesThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings (excluding tax audit claims) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.Tax AuditsThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. These uncertain tax matters may result in the assessment of additional taxes.On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets. The Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates. To resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as compensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987 through 1995 tax years. The IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006. 16The September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to do so. The IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.The Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice. Prior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.The trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11, 2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co. opinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a decision, in the Company’s case.The Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on appeal and vigorously defend its position. In determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis. The Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of June 30, 2023. However, we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of June 30, 2023 to $439 million.While the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, 17and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years with consent of the federal courts. This impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. The Company estimates the impact of the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 would increase the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability by approximately $400 million and $800 million, respectively. Additionally, we currently project the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5 percent.The Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee, the Company and the IRS will be provided time to agree on the tax impact of both opinions, after which the Tax Court would render a decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately $5.5 billion (including interest accrued through June 30, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal. Risk Management ProgramsThe Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. However, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $192 million and $199 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.NOTE 10: OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AOCI attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company is separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of The Coca-Cola Company’s shareowners’ equity, which also includes our proportionate share of equity method investees’ AOCI.

Gross transfers between levels within the hierarchy were not significant for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022.Nonrecurring Fair Value MeasurementsDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $25 million related to the discontinuation of certain manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific. This impairment charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by management’s best estimate of the potential proceeds from the disposal of the related assets. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2022, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96 million related to an equity method investee in Russia. This impairment charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $24 million on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The net loss was recorded as a result of an equity method investee issuing additional shares of its stock. Accordingly, the Company is required to treat this type of transaction as if the Company had sold a proportionate share of its investment. This net loss was determined using Level 2 inputs and primarily resulted from the recognition of cumulative translation losses. Other Fair Value DisclosuresThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and loans and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the relatively short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted prices for those instruments. Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk and the contractual terms of the debt instruments. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $36,797 million and $32,382 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value and fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $36,776 million and $32,698 million, respectively.28NOTE 17: OPERATING SEGMENTS Information about our Company’s operations by operating segment and Corporate is as follows (in millions):1Principally equity method investments and other investments in bottling companies.2Property, plant and equipment — net in the Philippines represented 10 percent of consolidated property, plant and equipment — net as of June 30, 2023, July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 3Property, plant and equipment — net in India represented 10 percent of consolidated property, plant and equipment — net as of June 30, 2023.

Refer to Note 16.31Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsWhen used in this report, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESRecoverability of Current and Noncurrent AssetsOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the headings “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I and “Our Business — Challenges and Risks” in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. We perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.The performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’ financial condition. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management’s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore these assets are more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. OPERATIONS REVIEWSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters typically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed BrandsIn order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company’s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other 32customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.When we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading “Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales, to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,” which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We report unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s divestitures.“Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.In May 2023 and July 2022, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment. Also, in August 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi. The impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments operating segment. Additionally, in November 2022, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Cambodia. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.In January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.Beverage VolumeWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for 33which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers’ inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. Information about our volume growth worldwide and for each of our operating segments is as follows: 1Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.2Geographic and Global Ventures operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. Global Ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume growth for Costa retail stores. 3Unit case volume percent change is based on average daily sales. Unit case volume growth based on average daily sales is computed by comparing the average daily sales in each of the corresponding periods. Average daily sales are the unit cases sold during the period divided by the number of days in the period.4Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers and is not based on average daily sales. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers and is not based on average daily sales. Each of our quarters, other than the fourth quarter, ends on the Friday closest to the last day of the corresponding quarterly calendar period. As a result, the first quarter of 2023 had one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2022, and the fourth quarter of 2023 will have one additional day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.5After considering the impact of structural changes, unit case volume for Bottling Investments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 grew 5 percent.34Unit Case Volume Although a significant portion of our Company’s net operating revenues is not based directly on unit case volume, we believe unit case volume performance is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Three Months Ended July 1, 2022Unit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased 5 percent, which included a 6 percent decline in sparkling flavors, a 2 percent decline in Trademark Coca-Cola, a 23 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and a 6 percent decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. The operating segment reported a decline in unit case volume of 7 percent in the Europe operating unit and a decline of 5 percent in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit, partially offset by growth of 1 percent in the Africa operating unit. The declines in the Europe operating unit, in Trademark Coca-Cola, and in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages were primarily due to the suspension of the Company’s business in Russia in 2022.Unit case volume in Latin America increased 4 percent, which included 10 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 3 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 2 percent growth in sparkling flavors, and 3 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment’s volume performance included 3 percent growth in Mexico and 4 percent growth in Brazil. Unit case volume in North America decreased 1 percent, which included a 5 percent decline in water, sports, coffee and tea and a 1 percent decline in Trademark Coca-Cola, partially offset by 2 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1 percent growth in sparkling flavors.Unit case volume in Asia Pacific increased 2 percent, which included 10 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages as well as 2 percent growth in both sparkling flavors and Trademark Coca-Cola, partially offset by a 1 percent decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 5 percent in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit and growth of 2 percent in the Greater China and Mongolia operating unit, partially offset by a decline of 1 percent in both the Japan and South Korea operating unit and the ASEAN and South Pacific operating unit.Unit case volume for Global Ventures increased 4 percent, driven by 2 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea along with growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 1 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1 percent, which included the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia and a decline in unit case volume in the Philippines, partially offset by growth in unit case volume in India and South Africa.Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Six Months Ended July 1, 2022Unit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased 4 percent, which included a 26 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, a 5 percent decline in sparkling flavors, and a 7 percent decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in Trademark Coca-Cola was even. The operating segment reported a decline in unit case volume of 7 percent in the Europe operating unit and a decline of 1 percent in the Africa operating unit. Unit case volume in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit was even. The declines in the Europe operating unit and in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages were primarily due to the suspension of the Company’s business in Russia in 2022.Unit case volume in Latin America increased 5 percent, which included 10 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 3 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 2 percent growth in sparkling flavors, and 4 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment’s volume performance included 4 percent growth in Mexico and 5 percent growth in Brazil.Unit case volume in North America was even, which included 3 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1 percent growth in sparkling flavors, offset by a 5 percent decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in Trademark Coca-Cola was even.Unit case volume in Asia Pacific increased 6 percent, which included 6 percent growth in sparkling flavors, 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 13 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and 4 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 12 percent in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit and growth of 7 percent in the Greater China and Mongolia operating unit. Unit case volume in both the ASEAN and South Pacific operating unit and the Japan and South Korea operating unit was even.Unit case volume for Global Ventures increased 5 percent, driven by 2 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea along with growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 3 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.35Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1 percent, which included the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia and a decline in unit case volume in the Philippines, partially offset by growth in unit case volume in India and South Africa.Concentrate Sales VolumeDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, worldwide concentrate sales volume increased 1 percent and unit case volume was even compared to the three months ended July 1, 2022. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, worldwide concentrate sales volume increased 1 percent and unit case volume increased 2 percent compared to the six months ended July 1, 2022. Concentrate sales volume growth is calculated based on the amount sold during the reporting periods, which is impacted by the number of days. Conversely, unit case volume growth is calculated based on average daily sales, which is not impacted by the number of days in the reporting periods. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 had one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2022, which also contributed to the differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates on a consolidated basis and for the individual operating segments during the six months ended June 30, 2023. We expect the differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates to lessen over the remainder of the year.Net Operating Revenues Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Three Months Ended July 1, 2022During the three months ended June 30, 2023, net operating revenues were $11,972 million, compared to $11,325 million during the three months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $647 million, or 6 percent.The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments:Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.1Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed by comparing the total sales (rather than the average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.2Includes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above.Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.“Price, product and geographic mix” refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. The impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating revenues. Management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following items had on the Company’s net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the Company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products and packages sold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where products were sold. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.36Price, product and geographic mix had a 10 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following:•Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Türkiye and Zimbabwe;•Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along with favorable channel and package mix; •North America — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix;•Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;•Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the favorable performance of Costa in the United Kingdom, partially offset by unfavorable product mix; and•Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 4 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the South African rand, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira, Argentine peso, Indian rupee and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange” below.“Acquisitions and divestitures” generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company’s net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company’s performance. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Six Months Ended July 1, 2022During the six months ended June 30, 2023, net operating revenues were $22,952 million, compared to $21,816 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $1,136 million, or 5 percent.The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments:Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.1Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed by comparing the total sales (rather than the average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.2Includes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above.37Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.Price, product and geographic mix had a 10 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following:•Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Türkiye and Zimbabwe;•Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along with favorable channel and package mix; •North America — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix;•Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;•Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the favorable performance of Costa in the United Kingdom, offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year; and•Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 5 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, South African rand, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira, British pound sterling, Indian rupee and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Global Ventures; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange” below.Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2023 net operating revenues.Gross Profit MarginGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. Our gross profit margin increased to 59.0 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 57.3 percent for the three months ended July 1, 2022. Our gross profit margin increased to 59.8 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 59.1 percent for the six months ended July 1, 2022. These increases were primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. We expect commodity costs to continue to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin during the remainder of 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $118 million, or 4 percent, and increased $336 million, or 5 percent, respectively, versus the prior year. The increases were primarily due to 38increased operating expenses and increased advertising expenses, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively.As of June 30, 2023, we had $371 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards.Other Operating ChargesOther operating charges incurred by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,338 million. These charges consisted of $1,262 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife, LLC (“fairlife”) in 2020, $35 million related to the discontinuation of certain manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific and $24 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program. In addition, other operating charges included $8 million related to the restructuring of our North America operating unit, $6 million related to tax litigation expense and $3 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”) acquisition in 2021.During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,449 million. These charges consisted of $1,324 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $51 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program and $35 million related to the discontinuation of certain manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific. In addition, other operating charges included $26 million related to the restructuring of our North America operating unit, $7 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the BodyArmor acquisition and $6 million related to tax litigation expense.During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the Company recorded other operating charges of $951 million. These charges consisted of $917 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $19 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program and $13 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor termination fees recorded in 2021. Additionally, the Company recorded charges of $1 million related to its strategic realignment initiatives primarily as a result of a revision to estimated severance costs accrued in 2021 and charges of $1 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States.During the six months ended July 1, 2022, the Company recorded other operating charges of $979 million. These charges consisted of $939 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $29 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program, $8 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor termination fees recorded in 2021, and $3 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States.Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s restructuring initiatives. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fairlife acquisition. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments and Corporate. 39Operating Income and Operating MarginInformation about our operating income contribution by operating segment and Corporate on a percentage basis is as follows:Operating margin is a ratio calculated by dividing operating income by net operating revenues. Management believes operating margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business after considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. Information about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments and Corporate is as follows:* Calculation is not meaningful.Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Three Months Ended July 1, 2022During the three months ended June 30, 2023, operating income was $2,401 million, compared to $2,341 million during the three months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $60 million, or 3 percent. The increase was driven by favorable pricing initiatives, concentrate sales volume growth of 1 percent, and favorable channel and package mix. These items were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact; higher other operating charges; and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.During the three months ended June 30, 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 10 percent due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Zimbabwean dollar, euro, Turkish lira, and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange” below.The Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment reported operating income of $1,133 million and $1,291 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 11 percent, a decline in concentrate sales volume of 5 percent, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, and higher commodity costs, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives.Latin America reported operating income of $797 million and $674 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 408 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and favorable channel and package mix, partially offset by increased marketing spending, higher commodity costs, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 7 percent.Operating income for North America for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $1,216 million and $840 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix, partially offset by higher other operating charges, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent. Asia Pacific’s operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $673 million and $753 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 4 percent, a decline in concentrate sales volume of 1 percent, higher commodity costs, higher other operating charges, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives, decreased marketing spending, and the impact of acquired brands.Global Ventures’ operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $78 million and $44 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 8 percent and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.Bottling Investments’ operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $122 million and $113 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by unit case volume growth of 5 percent and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent and the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia.Corporate’s operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $1,618 million and $1,374 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2023 increased primarily as a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition.Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Six Months Ended July 1, 2022During the six months ended June 30, 2023, operating income was $5,768 million, compared to $5,746 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022. The increase was driven by favorable pricing initiatives, concentrate sales volume growth of 1 percent, and favorable channel and package mix. These items were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact; higher other operating charges; and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 9 percent due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Zimbabwean dollar, euro, Turkish lira, and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange” below.The Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment reported operating income of $2,268 million and $2,298 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 13 percent, a decline in concentrate sales volume of 2 percent, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, and higher commodity costs, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives.Latin America reported operating income of $1,650 million and $1,434 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 4 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and favorable channel and package mix, partially offset by increased marketing spending, higher commodity costs, higher operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent.Operating income for North America for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $2,249 million and $1,896 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix, partially offset by a decline in concentrate sales volume of 1 percent, higher other operating charges, higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, and higher operating expenses. Asia Pacific’s operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $1,236 million and $1,417 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent, a decline in concentrate sales volume of 1 percent, higher commodity costs, higher other operating charges, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives, decreased marketing spending, and the impact of acquired brands and structural changes.41Global Ventures’ operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $129 million and $95 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 8 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher commodity costs, the impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.Bottling Investments’ operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $261 million and $306 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 5 percent and the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia, partially offset by unit case volume growth of 4 percent and favorable pricing initiatives.Corporate’s operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $2,025 million and $1,700 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2023 increased primarily as a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition.Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2023 operating income.Interest IncomeDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, interest income was $224 million, compared to $100 million during the three months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $124 million, or 124 percent. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, interest income was $392 million, compared to $178 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $214 million, or 120 percent. The increases were primarily driven by higher average investment balances and higher returns on our Corporate and certain international investments.Interest ExpenseDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, interest expense was $374 million, compared to $198 million during the three months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $176 million, or 88 percent. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, interest expense was $746 million, compared to $380 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $366 million, or 96 percent. The increases were primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term borrowings and derivative instruments compared to the prior year.Equity Income (Loss) — NetThree Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Three Months Ended July 1, 2022During the three months ended June 30, 2023, equity income was $538 million, compared to equity income of $392 million during the three months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $146 million, or 37 percent. The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by some of our equity method investees in the current year as well as a $33 million decrease in net charges resulting from the Company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Six Months Ended July 1, 2022During the six months ended June 30, 2023, equity income was $813 million, compared to equity income of $654 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022, an increase of $159 million, or 24 percent. The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by some of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by a $54 million increase in net charges resulting from the Company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.Other Income (Loss) — NetThree Months Ended June 30, 2023 versus Three Months Ended July 1, 2022During the three months ended June 30, 2023, other income (loss) — net was income of $91 million. The Company recognized a net gain of $127 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $96 million. Additionally, other income (loss) — net included dividend income of $62 million and income of $12 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost.During the three months ended July 1, 2022, other income (loss) — net was a loss of $351 million. The Company recognized a net loss of $267 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96 million related to an equity method investee in Russia and recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $81 million. 42Additionally, other income (loss) — net included income of $67 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income and dividend income of $36 million.

Additionally, other income (loss) — net included income of $137 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income and dividend income of $48 million.Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on equity and debt securities. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on net periodic benefit cost or income. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impairment charge and one of our equity method investees issuing additional shares of its stock. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact that certain of these items had on our operating segments and Corporate. Income TaxesThe Company recorded income taxes of $359 million (12.5 percent effective tax rate) and $384 million (16.8 percent effective tax rate) during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The Company recorded income taxes of $1,299 million (18.7 percent effective tax rate) and $1,049 million (18.3 percent effective tax rate) during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 vary from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 21.0 percent primarily due to the tax impact of significant operating and nonoperating items, as described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, along with the tax benefits of having significant earnings generated outside of the United States and significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method, both of which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 included $120 million and $125 million, respectively, of net tax benefits related to various discrete tax items, including a change in tax law in a certain foreign jurisdiction. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) issued an opinion (“Opinion”) regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the Tax Court predominantly sided with the IRS. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.At the end of each quarter, we make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. This estimate reflects, among other items, our best estimate of operating results and foreign currency exchange rates. Based on enacted tax laws, as well as our current interpretation of recently issued regulations, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be 19.3 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. This rate does not include the impact of the ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the Company were not to prevail.43LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITIONWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners’ equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.The Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $15.7 billion as of June 30, 2023. In addition to these funds, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.2 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of June 30, 2023. These backup lines of credit expire at various times through 2028. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.9 billion. During 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.We are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS; however, a decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS were to be ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the consent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the underlying methodology (“Tax Court Methodology”) to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. The Company estimates the impact of the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology for the six months ended June 30, 2023 would increase the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability by approximately $800 million. Once the Tax Court renders a decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice of appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be approximately $5.5 billion (including interest accrued through June 30, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation. While we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.Based on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $7,197 million and $3,686 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $31 million and $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. 44Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $4,629 million and $4,546 million, respectively, an increase of $83 million, or 2 percent. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating income, the timing of working capital initiatives and lower marketing payments resulting from year-end accruals. These items were partially offset by an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax payments, payments resulting from the buildup of inventory in the prior year to manage potential supply chain disruptions and $167 million of the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone payment for fairlife.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $766 million and $1,145 million, respectively. Purchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of InvestmentsDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, purchases of investments were $2,103 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $1,608 million, resulting in a net cash outflow of $495 million. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, purchases of investments were $2,040 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $2,272 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $232 million. This activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the Company’s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our investments.Proceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable SecuritiesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $320 million and $218 million, respectively, which primarily related to sales of our ownership interests in certain equity method investees. Purchases of Property, Plant and EquipmentPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 were $615 million and $487 million, respectively.Collateral (Paid) Received Associated with Hedging Activities — NetCollateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $15 million and $984 million, respectively. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $998 million and $3,950 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively.Debt FinancingIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had issuances of debt of $4,638 million, which included $733 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $3,892 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, and long-term debt issuances of $13 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.The Company made payments of debt of $2,366 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, which included payments of $2,188 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $178 million. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,256 million, which included $1,346 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $1,408 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, and long-term debt issuances of $502 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.The Company made payments of debt of $1,816 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022, which included payments of $1,250 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $566 million. 45On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, continued to be published through June 2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities.Issuances of StockThe issuances of stock during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.Share RepurchasesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,084 million. The Company repurchased 16.1 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average cost of $60.94 per share, for a total cost of $980 million. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plan, the Company’s treasury stock activity included shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and share repurchases during the six months ended June 30, 2023 resulted in a net cash outflow of $725 million. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,210 million. The Company repurchased 18.3 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average cost of $62.62 per share, for a total cost of $1,148 million. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plan, the Company’s treasury stock activity included shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and share repurchases during the six months ended July 1, 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $558 million. DividendsDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, the Company paid dividends of $2,089 million and $3,810 million, respectively. As a result of the timing of our quarterly reporting periods as well as our dividend payment dates, the Company paid substantially all of the 2023 second quarterly dividend in the third quarter and paid all of the 2022 second quarterly dividend in the second quarter.Our Board of Directors approved the Company’s regular quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share at its July 2023 meeting. This dividend is payable on October 2, 2023 to shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 15, 2023.Other Financing Activities During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $456 million and $1,022 million, respectively.

The cash outflow during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 included payments totaling $311 million and $568 million, respectively, of the purchase price of BodyArmor, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations. Additionally, the cash outflow during the six months ended July 1, 2022 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone payment for fairlife.Foreign ExchangeOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies.Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income. Taking into account the effects of our hedging activities, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 by 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively.46Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on operating income and cash flows from operating activities through the end of the year.Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe have no material changes to the disclosures on this matter made in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresThe Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 47Part II. Other InformationItem 1. Legal ProceedingsInformation regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following updates and restates the description of the previously reported U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute matter.U.S. Federal Income Tax DisputeOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets. The Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates. To resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as compensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987 through 1995 tax years. The IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006. The September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to do so. The IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.The Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice. Prior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.The trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11, 2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co. opinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a decision, in the Company’s case.The Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that 48the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on appeal and vigorously defend its position. In determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis. The Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of June 30, 2023. However, we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of June 30, 2023 to $439 million.While the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years with consent of the federal courts. This impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. The Company estimates the impact of the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 would increase the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability by approximately $400 million and $800 million, respectively. Additionally, we currently project the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5 percent.The Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee, the Company and the IRS will be provided time to agree on the tax impact of both opinions, after which the Tax Court would render a decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately $5.5 billion (including interest accrued through June 30, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal. Item 1A.
