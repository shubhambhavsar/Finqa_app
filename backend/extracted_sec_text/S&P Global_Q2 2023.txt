Results of Review of Interim Financial StatementsWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of S&P Global Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and equity for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedule (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 9, 2023, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.Basis for Review ResultsThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion./s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLPNew York, New YorkJuly 27, 20233PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATIONItem 1.

Nature of Operations and Basis of PresentationS&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “S&P Global,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, automotive and engineering markets.Our operations consist of six reportable segments: S&P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&P Global Ratings (“Ratings”), S&P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&P Global Mobility (“Mobility”), S&P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices” ) and S&P Global Engineering Solutions (“Engineering Solutions”).•Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.•Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.•Commodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.•Mobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies. •Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.•Engineering Solutions is a leading provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge. As of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions and the results are included through that date.On May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions to Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”). We received the full proceeds from the sale of $975 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, which we expect to result in approximately $750 million in after-tax proceeds. The assets and liabilities of Engineering Solutions were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $120 million in Loss (gain) on dispositions and disposition-related costs of $3 million in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($189 million after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $101 million) related to the sale of Engineering Solutions. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $120 million in Loss (gain) on dispositions and disposition-related costs of $16 million in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($182 million after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $157 million) related to the sale of Engineering Solutions. Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of Engineering Solutions are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023. The transaction follows our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit. On February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit Ltd (“IHS Markit”), and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&P Global, and the financial results include IHS Markit from the date of acquisition. The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, the financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (our “Form 10-K”). Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current presentation.In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods have been included. The operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.10On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Since the date of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.Restricted CashRestricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheets was $1 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.Contract AssetsContract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, contract assets were $97 million and $60 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Unearned RevenueWe record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance at June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, partially offset by $2.0 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period.Remaining Performance ObligationsRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of June 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $4.0 billion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately half and three-quarters of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter. We do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.Costs to Obtain a ContractWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $194 million and $175 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately 5 years. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses.We expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.Equity in Income on Unconsolidated SubsidiariesThe Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combined each company’s post-trade services into a joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME’s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company’s MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both businesses to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Other Income, netThe components of other income, net for the periods ended June 30 are as follows:112.

The acquisition of ChartIQ is not material to our consolidated financial statements.On January 4, 2023, we completed the acquisition of TruSight Solutions LLC (“TruSight”) a provider of third-party vendor risk assessments. The acquisition will be integrated into our Market Intelligence segment and further expands the breadth and depth of S&P Global’s third party vendor risk management solutions by offering high-quality validated assessment data to clients designed to reduce further the vendor due diligence burden on service providers to the financial services industry. The acquisition of TruSight is not material to our consolidated financial statements.2022Merger with IHS Markit On February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit. The fair value of the consideration transferred for IHS Markit was approximately $43.5 billion.Allocation of Purchase PriceThe merger with IHS Markit was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The allocation of purchase price recorded for IHS Markit is as follows:12Acquired Identifiable Intangible AssetsThe following table sets forth the fair values of the components of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and their useful lives:Divestitures2023On May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions to Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”). We received the full proceeds from the sale of $975 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, which we expect to result in approximately $750 million in after-tax proceeds. The assets and liabilities of Engineering Solutions were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance 13sheet as of December 31, 2022. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $120 million in Loss (gain) on dispositions and disposition-related costs of $3 million in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($189 million after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $101 million) related to the sale of Engineering Solutions. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $120 million in Loss (gain) on dispositions and disposition-related costs of $16 million in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($182 million after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $157 million) related to the sale of Engineering Solutions. Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of Engineering Solutions are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023. The transaction follows our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit. In the first quarter of 2023, we received a contingent payment following the sale of Leveraged Commentary and Data (“LCD”) along with a related family of leveraged loan indices in June of 2022. The contingent payment was payable six months following the closing upon the achievement of certain conditions related to the transition of LCD customer relationships. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the contingent payment resulted in a pre-tax gain of $46 million ($34 million after-tax) related to the sale of LCD in our Market Intelligence segment and $4 million ($3 million after-tax) in Loss (gain) on dispositions related to the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in our Indices segment.2022As a condition of securing regulatory approval for the merger, S&P Global and IHS Markit agreed to divest of certain of their businesses. S&P Global’s divestitures included CUSIP Global Services (“CGS”), its LCD business and a related family of leveraged loan indices while IHS Markit’s divestitures included Oil Price Information Services (“OPIS”); Coal, Metals and Mining; and PetroChem Wire businesses and its Base Chemicals business.In June of 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of LCD along with a related family of leveraged loan indices, within our Market Intelligence and Indices segments, respectively, to Morningstar for a purchase price of $600 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments, and a contingent payment of up to $50 million which was payable six months following the closing upon the achievement of certain conditions related to the transition of LCD customer relationships. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $518 million ($396 million after-tax) for the sale of LCD and $38 million ($31 million after-tax) for the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in Loss (gain) on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income.In June of 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of the Base Chemicals business to News Corp for $295 million in cash. We did not recognize a gain on the sale of the Base Chemicals business.In March of 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of CGS, a business within our Market Intelligence segment, to FactSet Research Systems Inc. for a purchase price of $1.925 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.344 billion ($1.006 billion after-tax) in Loss (gain) on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income related to the sale of CGS.In February of 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of OPIS to News Corp for $1.150 billion in cash. We did not recognize a gain on the sale of OPIS.14Assets and Liabilities Held for SaleThe components of assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:1 Assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2022 relate to Engineering Solutions.The operating profit of our businesses that were disposed of for the periods ended June 30 is as follows:1 The operating profit presented includes the revenue and recurring direct expenses associated with businesses disposed of or held for sale. The three and six months ended June 30, 2023 excludes a pre-tax loss related to the sale of Engineering Solutions of $120 million. The three and six months ended June 30, 2022 excludes a pre-tax gain related to the sale LCD and a related family of leveraged loan indices of $518 million and $38 million, respectively. The six months ended June 30, 2022 also excludes a pre-tax gain related to the sale of CGS of $1.3 billion.3. Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was 31.1% and 23.8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and 24.5% and 27.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The higher rate for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax charge on divestitures. The higher rate for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the tax charge on merger related divestitures and deal related non-deductible costs.At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant unusual or infrequently occurring items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect, and are individually computed, is recognized in the interim period in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs.The Company is continuously subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits was $245 million and $223 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $47 million and $38 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $20 million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations.For tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development costs pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174. Section 174 requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development costs and amortize them over 5 years for expenditures attributed to domestic research and 15 years for expenditures attributed to foreign research. This provision affects a significant proportion of the 15Company for the first time in 2023. The actual impact of Section 174 capitalization and amortization on the income tax payable and deferred tax asset will depend on multiple factors, including the amount of research and development expenses we will incur and whether we conduct our research and development activities inside or outside the United States. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer, repeal or otherwise modify this capitalization and amortization requirement, the possibility that this will happen is uncertain. If legislation is not passed to defer, repeal, or otherwise modify the capitalization and amortization requirement we expect our cash taxes to be greater than in the prior year.4. Debt A summary of short-term and long-term debt outstanding is as follows:1 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 1 and August 1.2 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 1 and November 1.3 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15.4 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1.5 Interest payments are due semiannually on January 22 and July 22, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $3 million.6 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $12 million.7 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 1 and August 1.8 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 1 and November 1.9 Interest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $3 million.10 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $16 million.11 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $6 million.1612 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $27 million.13 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $2 million. 14 Interest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $11 million. 15 Interest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $10 million.16 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $26 million.17 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $17 million.18 Interest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 and as of June 30, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $14 million. The fair value of our total debt borrowings was $9.4 billion and $9.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.On February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit in an all-stock transaction. In the transaction, we assumed IHS Markit's publicly traded debt, with an outstanding principal balance of $4.6 billion, which was recorded at fair value of $4.9 billion on the acquisition date. The adjustment to fair value of the Senior Notes of approximately $292 million on the acquisition date is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining contractual terms of the Senior Notes. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we recognized a $19 million loss on extinguishment of debt which includes a $118 million tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer, offset by a $99 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt.We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, there was $740 million and $188 million of commercial paper outstanding.Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.The only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.5. Derivative InstrumentsOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.17Undesignated Derivative InstrumentsDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $21 million and $5 million, respectively. The amount recorded in other current liabilities as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $1 million and $37 million, respectively. The amount recorded in selling and general expense related to these contracts was a net gain of $29 million and $58 million for three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and a net loss of $49 million and $69 million for three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.Net Investment HedgesAs of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2024, 2029 and 2030. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $1 billion. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of $6 million and $12 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and net interest expense of $8 million and $18 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.Cash Flow HedgesForeign Exchange Forward Contracts During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the second quarter of 2025 and the fourth quarter of 2024, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within twenty-four months. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of June 30, 2023, we estimate that $7 million of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $443 million and $529 million, respectively.Interest Rate SwapsAs of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we held positions in a series of interest rate swaps. These contracts are intended to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing and are scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and will be subsequently reclassified into interest expense, net in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.As of June 30, 2023 and December 31,2022, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $1.4 billion.18The following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:The following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the periods ended June 30:Three MonthsSix Months19The activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the periods ended June 30: 6. Employee Benefits We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.We also have supplemental benefit plans providing senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts. We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active and retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.We recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.Net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.20The components of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement plans and postretirement plans for the periods ended June 30 are as follows: Net periodic benefit cost related to our postretirement plans reflected in the table above was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.As discussed in our Form 10-K, we changed certain discount rate assumptions for our retirement and postretirement plans and our expected return on assets assumption for our retirement plans which became effective on January 1, 2023. The effect of the assumption changes on retirement and postretirement expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In the first six months of 2023, we contributed $5 million to our retirement plans and expect to make additional required contributions of approximately $5 million to our retirement plans during the remainder of the year. We may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance or any potential deterioration of our pension plan status in the second half of 2023.7. Stock-Based CompensationWe issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. Total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and other stock-based awards was $97 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and $143 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Stock-based compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily related to the early vesting of IHS Markit equity awards as a result of employee terminations and restructuring efforts. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company granted 0.5 million shares of restricted stock and other stock-based awards, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of $350.42 per share. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity awards as of June 30, 2023 was $235 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. 8. EquityDividendsOn January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividends for 2023 to a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.90 per share.Stock RepurchasesOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of June 30, 2023, 22.9 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 repurchase program was complete. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.21We enter into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as two transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts were classified as equity instruments. The terms of each ASR agreement entered into during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, structured as outlined above, are as follows: 1 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $1 billion and initially received shares valued at 87.5% of the $1 billion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on May 8, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of 2.5 million shares from the ASR program. The final settlement of the transaction under the ASR is expected to be completed no later than the third quarter of 2023. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program. 2 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $500 million and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $500 million at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on February 13, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on May 5, 2023 and received an additional 0.3 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.3 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $1.5 billion and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $1.5 billion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on May 13, 2022 when the Company received an initial delivery of 3.8 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 2, 2022 and received an additional 0.6 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program.4 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $7 billion and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $7 billion at a price equal to the then market price of the Company's common stock on March 1, 2022 when the company received an initial delivery of 15.2 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 9, 2022 and received an additional 4.1 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program.During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received 4.3 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in February of 2023 related to our December 2, 2022 ASR agreement. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we purchased a total of 3.9 million shares for $1.5 billion of cash. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we purchased a total of 19.0 million shares for $8.5 billion of cash.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe agreement with the minority partners that own 27% of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (“CGIS”) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the 15 days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest.If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using 22both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity. Changes to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the six months ended June 30, 2023 were as follows: 1 Relates to foreign currency translation adjustments.Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the six months ended June 30, 2023:1Includes an unrealized gain related to our cross currency swaps. See Note 5 – Derivative Instruments for additional detail of items recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 2Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses and is net of a tax benefit of less than $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. See Note 6 — Employee Benefits for additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.3See Note 5 — Derivative Instruments for additional details of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.9. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted performance shares calculated using the treasury stock method. 23The calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the periods ended June 30 is as follows:We have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no stock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstanding of 0.8 million and 0.6 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded.10. RestructuringWe continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2023 and 2022 restructuring plan consisted of a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately 290 and 1,440 positions, respectively, and is further detailed below. The charges for the restructuring plans are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed.The initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of June 30, 2023 by segment is as follows:We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $62 million primarily related to employee severance charges for the 2023 restructuring plan during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and have reduced the reserve by $6 million. 24The ending reserve balance for the 2022 restructuring plan was $164 million as of December 31, 2022. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we have reduced the reserve for the 2022 restructuring plan by $91 million. The ending reserve balance for the 2021 restructuring plan was $2 million and $10 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges.11.

The following provides revenue by geographic region for the periods ended June 30:See Note 2 — Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 10 — Restructuring for additional actions that impacted the segment operating results. 12. Commitments and Contingencies Leases We determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement. We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 10 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 15 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 we a recorded pre-tax impairment charge of $5 million and $11 million related to the impairment and abandonment of operating lease related ROU assets. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 we a recorded pre-tax impairment charge of $20 million and $25 million, respectively, related to the impairment and abandonment of operating lease related ROU assets.The pre-tax impairment charge recorded during the three months ended 28June 30, 2022 is primarily associated with consolidating our real estate facilities following the merger with IHS Markit. The impairment charges are included in selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income.The following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:The components of lease expense for the periods ended June 30 are as follows: Supplemental information related to leases for the periods ended June 30 are as follows:Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:Maturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases are as follows: 29Related Party AgreementsIn June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement") with the holder of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, replacing the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $45 million and $89 million, respectively, of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $46 million and $87 million, respectively, of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the 27% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.Contractual ObligationsWe typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. In the first quarter of 2023, S&P Global and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration agreement with a purchase obligation of $1.0 billion, before incremental credits, over a five-year period. With AWS as its preferred cloud provider, S&P Global will enhance its cloud infrastructure, accelerate business growth, engineer new innovations for key industry segments, and help their customers navigate rapidly changing market conditions.Legal and Regulatory MattersIn the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.A class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company. A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by two entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis. We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.From time to time, the Company receives customer complaints. The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers. Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints. The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters.Moreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S&P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.3013. Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting StandardsIn March of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance that requires all entities to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control leases over the useful life to the common control group. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March of 2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current contract modifications and hedge accounting guidance in light of the expected market transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to alternative rates. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The transactions primarily include (1) contract modifications, (2) hedging relationships, and (3) sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. In December of 2022, the FASB amended its guidance to defer the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to adopt the amendments prospectively to transactions existing as of or entered into from the date of adoption through December 31, 2024. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 31Item 2.

The increase at Ratings was primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings transaction revenue driven by increased investment-grade and high-yield issuance volumes due to an increase in refinancing activity. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to subscription revenue growth for data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, Desktop products, and RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions. The increase at Mobility was primarily due to price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023. Revenue growth at Commodity Insights was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. The increase at Indices was primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.Operating profit decreased 39%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 45 percentage points and higher lease impairments in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 1%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives and higher compensation costs. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.Six MonthsRevenue increased 16% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit; subscription revenue growth for Desktop products, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, and data feed products within Data & Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence; continued demand for market data and market insights products and higher conference revenue at Commodity Insights; higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue at Indices; and growth in corporate bond ratings transaction revenue driven by increased investment-grade and high-yield issuance volumes due to an increase in refinancing activity at Ratings. These increases were partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions which was unfavorably impacted by the sale on May 2, 2023 and lower bank loan ratings revenue at Ratings. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.33Operating profit decreased 39%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 61 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles in 2023 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 8 percentage points, the impact of a S&P Foundation grant in 2022 of 6 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 10%.

Subscription revenue increased due growth in data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, Desktop products, and RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions at Market Intelligence, price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023 at Mobility, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and higher data subscription revenue at Indices, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions which was unfavorably impacted by its sale on May 2, 2023. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue driven by increased investment-grade and high-yield issuance volumes due to an increase in refinancing activity at Ratings. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue, higher Ratings Evaluation Service (“RES”) revenue and an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Asset linked fees decreased at Indices driven by product mix. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was primarily driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to fixed income new issuance volumes. See “Segment Review” below for further information. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Six MonthsRevenue increased 16% as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit.

Ratings Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and•bank loan ratings.Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue was $38 million and $74 million three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $36 million and $70 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the periods ended June 30: 1Operating profit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 includes employee severance charges of $4 million and $5 million, respectively. Operating profit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 includes employee severance charges of $7 million and $12 million, respectively. Additionally, operating profit includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and $4 million and $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.47Three MonthsRevenue increased 7%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue driven by increased investment-grade and high-yield issuance volumes primarily due to higher refinancing activity, partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenues and lower bank loan ratings revenue driven by decreased issuance volumes. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue, higher Ratings Evaluation Service (“RES”) revenue and an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. Operating profit increased 5%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 4% due to revenue growth, partially offset by prior-year write-downs in incentive compensation as result of financial performance and higher current-year compensation costs. Six MonthsRevenue increased 1%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue driven by increased investment-grade and high-yield issuance volumes primarily due to higher refinancing activity, partially offset by lower bank loan ratings revenue driven by decreased issuance volumes. Non-transaction revenue decreased due to a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. Operating profit decreased 1%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit decreased 2% primarily due to prior-year write-downs in incentive compensation as result of financial performance and higher current-year compensation costs, partially offset by revenue growth.Market Issuance VolumesWe monitor market issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located. Structured Finance issuance includes amounts when a transaction closes, not when initially priced, and excludes domestically rated Chinese issuance. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on data from SDC Platinum for Corporate bond issuance and based on a composite of external data feeds and Ratings' internal estimates for Structured Finance issuance.Note – Global issuance includes U.S., Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.* Includes Industrials and Financial Services.** Includes rated and non-rated issuance. •Corporate issuance was up in the second quarter and first half of 2023 in the U.S. and Europe driven by strong increases in high-yield issuance and investment-grade issuance in the quarter due to an increase in refinancing activity ahead of the U.S. debt ceiling expiration date and anticipated interest rate increases.48Note – Global issuance includes U.S., Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.* Represents no activity in 2023 or 2022.•ABS issuance decreased in the U.S. driven by a decline in Credit Cards and Non-Traditional / Esoterics and was up in Europe although from a low 2022 base.•CLO issuance was down in the U.S. structured credit markets due to a decline in new and refinancing issuance and down in Europe due to a decline in refinancing issuance. •CMBS issuance was down in the U.S. and Europe reflecting unfavorable market conditions. •RMBS issuance was down in the U.S. reflecting unfavorable market conditions. •Covered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in Europe increased with the elimination of cheaper government funding programs.

For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory matters see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses. Cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.55Cash Flow OverviewCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1,562 million as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $275 million from December 31, 2022.The following table provides cash flow information for the six months ended June 30: In the first six months of 2023, free cash flow increased $654 million to $1,164 million compared to $510 million in the first six months of 2022. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.Operating activitiesCash provided by operating activities increased $687 million to $1,363 million for the first six months of 2023. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2023, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 and a grant payment to the S&P Global Foundation in 2022.For the first six months of 2023, our cash taxes were adversely impacted by the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses under Internal Revenue Code Section 174. If legislation is not passed to defer, repeal, or otherwise modify the capitalization and amortization requirement we expect our cash taxes to be greater than in the prior year. See Note 3 – Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further information.Investing activities Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.Cash provided by investing activities decreased to $656 million for the first six months of 2023 compared to $3,745 million in the first six months of 2022, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received from dispositions in 2022 related to the dispositions of CUSIP Global Services, Oil Price Information Services, the Leveraged Commentary and Data business and a related family of leveraged loan indices, and the Base Chemicals business. See Note 2 — Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion.Financing activitiesOur cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.Cash used for financing activities decreased $5,521 million to $1,747 million for the first six months of 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we purchased a total of 3.9 million shares for $1.5 billion of cash. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we purchased a total of 19.0 million shares for $8.5 billion of cash. See Note 8 — Equity to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion.56Contractual ObligationsWe typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. In the first quarter of 2023, S&P Global and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration agreement with a purchase obligation of $1.0 billion, before incremental credits, over a five-year period. With AWS as its preferred cloud provider, S&P Global will enhance its cloud infrastructure, accelerate business growth, engineer new innovations for key industry segments, and help their customers navigate rapidly changing market conditions.Additional FinancingWe have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, there was $740 million and $188 million of commercial paper outstanding.Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.The only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded. DividendsOn January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.90 per share.

This summarized financial information excludes the Non-Obligor Group. Intercompany balances and transactions between members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. This information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Summarized results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2023 are as follows: Summarized balance sheet information as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is as follows:RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. We believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.58The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the six months ended June 30: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 — Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in our most recent Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our most recent Form 10-K, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. These critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable non-controlling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Since the date of our most recent Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates.RECENTLY ISSUED OR ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 13 – Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further information.59FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report contains “forward-looking statements,” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, including statements about the completed merger (the “Merger”) between a subsidiary of the Company and IHS Markit Ltd. (“IHS Markit”), which express management’s current views concerning future events, trends, contingencies or results, appear at various places in this report and use words like “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “strategy,” “target” and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like “could,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “will” and “would.” For example, management may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: the outcome of contingencies; future actions by regulators; changes in the Company’s business strategies and methods of generating revenue; the development and performance of the Company’s services and products; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; the Company’s effective tax rates; and the Company’s cost structure, dividend policy, cash flows or liquidity.Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include, among other things:•worldwide economic, financial, political, and regulatory conditions (including slower GDP growth or recession, instability in the banking sector and inflation), and factors that contribute to uncertainty and volatility, natural and man-made disasters, civil unrest, pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), geopolitical uncertainty (including military conflict), and conditions that may result from legislative, regulatory, trade and policy changes;•the volatility and health of debt, equity, commodities and energy markets, including credit quality and spreads, the level of liquidity and future debt issuances, demand for investment products that track indices and assessments and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives;•the demand and market for credit ratings in and across the sectors and geographies where the Company operates;•the Company’s ability to maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of confidential information and data, and the potential for a system or network disruption that results in regulatory penalties and remedial costs or improper disclosure of confidential information or data;•the outcome of litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries;•concerns in the marketplace affecting the Company’s credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the integrity or utility of independent credit ratings, benchmarks, indices and other services;•our ability to attract, incentivize and retain key employees, especially in a competitive business environment;•the Company’s exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil penalties for noncompliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including sanctions laws relating to countries such as Iran, Russia, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, as well as import and export restrictions;•the continuously evolving regulatory environment in Europe, the United States and elsewhere around the globe affecting each of our business divisions and the products our business divisions offer, and our compliance therewith;•the ability of the Company to implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to IHS Markit’s business and realize expected synergies;•the Company’s ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the Merger;•the Company’s ability to make acquisitions and dispositions and successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;•consolidation of the Company’s customers, suppliers or competitors;•the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies;•our ability to develop new products or technologies, to integrate our products with new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence), or to compete with new products or technologies offered by new or existing competitors;•the effect of competitive products and pricing, including the level of success of new product developments and global expansion;•the impact of customer cost-cutting pressures;•a decline in the demand for our products and services by our customers and other market participants;•the ability of the Company, and its third-party service providers, to maintain adequate physical and technological infrastructure;•the Company’s ability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, civil unrest, protests, military conflict, terrorist attack, outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases, security breach, cyber attack, data breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event;•the level of merger and acquisition activity in the United States and abroad;•the level of the Company’s future cash flows and capital investments;•the impact on the Company’s revenue and net income caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and•the impact of changes in applicable tax or accounting requirements on the Company.60The factors noted above are not exhaustive. The Company and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks emerge frequently. Accordingly, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it is made, except as required by applicable law. Further information about the Company’s businesses, including information about factors that could materially affect its results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and Item 1A, Risk Factors in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.61Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and held cross-currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we held positions in a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 5 - Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed so that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.As of June 30, 2023, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 62PART II – OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal ProceedingsSee Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies - Legal & Regulatory Matters to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for information on our legal proceedings.Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors we have previously disclosed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our most recent Form 10-K, and the additional risk factor below.Cybersecurity, Technology and Innovation RisksOur approach to artificial intelligence may not be successful, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) is an emerging technology that is expected to fundamentally change the way data is gathered, protected, licensed, processed, and consumed. Given the importance of data to our products and services, AI is expected to become an increasingly important part of our business and industry. We have established a Company-wide AI strategy to drive our approach to data protection, licensing and AI integration in our processes, products and services. We have made significant investments in various AI initiatives. However, the AI landscape is complex and rapidly evolving, and new and enhanced laws and regulations, governmental or regulatory scrutiny, competition from established or emerging companies, litigation, ethical concerns, cybersecurity concerns, intellectual property concerns, or other complications could adversely impact our ability to protect our data and intellectual property, to develop and offer products and services that effectively use AI, to compete with other AI products or services, or to improve efficiency of producing existing products or services through the effective use of AI to remain competitive. For instance, competitors may deploy AI in ways that make processing of information relatively inexpensive or free, which could significantly reduce demand for our data. Additionally, we may be unable to effectively license or otherwise protect our data from unintended use by AI. For additional risks related to intellectual property rights, see the risk factor entitled “Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.” In addition, the number of approaches to integrating and commercializing AI is currently large, and many of those approaches may fail to gain market acceptance or become obsolete as AI continues to evolve. At this time, we are unable to predict which offerings will ultimately be successful. Notwithstanding our investments, our products and services may become less marketable or less competitive, or potentially obsolete if either our approach to integrating AI into our products and services fails to gain market acceptance or our approach to protecting our data and intellectual property is ultimately inadequate. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. During the second quarter of 2023, we received 2.8 million shares, which included 0.3 million shares received from our accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement that we entered into on February 13, 2023 and 2.5 million shares received from our ASR agreement that we entered into on May 8, 2023. Further discussion relating to our ASR agreements can be found in Note 8 - Equity. As of June 30, 2023, 22.9 million shares remained under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.The following table provides information on our purchases of our outstanding common stock during the second quarter of 2023 pursuant to the 2022 Repurchase Program (column c). In addition to these purchases, the number of shares in column (a) include shares of common stock that are tendered to us to satisfy our employees’ tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of restricted shares (we repurchase such shares based on their fair market value on the vesting date). There were no other share repurchases during the quarter outside the repurchases noted below.631 Includes 0.3 million shares received from the conclusion of our ASR agreement that we entered into on February 13, 2023. 2 Includes 2.5 million shares received from the initiation of our ASR agreement that we entered into on May 8, 2023. Average price paid per share information does not include this accelerated share repurchase transaction.Item 5. Other InformationIRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT DISCLOSUREPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether, during the reporting period, it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.During the second quarter of 2023, the Company engaged in limited transactions or dealings related to the purchase or sale of information and informational materials, which are generally exempt from U.S. economic sanctions, with persons that are owned or controlled, or appear to be owned or controlled, by the Government of Iran or are otherwise subject to disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. Commodities Insights provided subscribers access to proprietary data, analytics, and industry information that enable commodities markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency. Market Intelligence sourced certain trade data from Iran. The Company will continue to monitor such activities closely. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded no revenue or net profit attributable to the Commodities Insights transactions or dealings described above, which reflects the uncertainty of collection. The Company attributes a de minimis amount of gross revenues and net profits to the data sourced from Iran by Market Intelligence.RULE 10b5-1 PLAN ELECTIONSOn May 4, 2023, Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan for the sale of up to 23,502 shares of the Company’s common stock. Mr. Steenbergen’s plan will terminate on the earlier of (i) December 15, 2023 and (ii) the date on which all sales contemplated under the plan have been executed. Mr. Steenbergen’s plan is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”).
